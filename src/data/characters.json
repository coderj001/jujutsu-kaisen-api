He has thick eyebrows and his facial hair consists of a mustache and goatee combination. \nLike many other sorcerers, Masamichi always sports sunglasses. In 2017 he wore a white dress shirt underneath a black jacket with matching pants and shoes. In 2018 he began wearing a fully zipped-up long-sleeved black jacket with similar shoes and pants. In 2006, Masamichi's hair wasn't spiky yet and he had two straight parts wrapped around his head. He also didn't sport sunglasses as much back before he became principal.",
      "personality": "Masamichi's presence gets Satoru and Suguru to stop fighting.Masamichi was always a stern, thoughtful, and earnest man who served as a positive role model for all his staff and students at Jujutsu High. He had a strong moral center and a lot of patience, especially compared to the higher-ups. He was the primary mentor for Satoru and Suguru, who were particularly difficult individuals to deal with when they were students. Satoru once left a manager behind and then forgot to put up a  during a mission. Unsure of who did it, Masamichi spoke to all his students and gave them the chance to come clean. Satoru didn't own up to it properly so Masamichi punished him physically. \nSatoru and Suguru often clashed over their conflicting views on sorcery but Masamichi's authoritative presence got them to stop squabbling as soon as he entered the room. As students with spirited personalities, Satoru and Suguru messed with Masamichi all the time. When Masamichi assigned the duo the escort mission for the , they said that he finally lost it and had gotten carried away after being named the next principal. This annoyed Masamichi as usual but he was willing to put it aside after telling them he would decide whether they were joking or not.\nMasamichi and Satoru both deeply distraught over Suguru going rogue.Masamichi is still constantly irritated by Satoru even after he grew up. Satoru is constantly late to their meetings even after Masamichi repeatedly reminds him not to do so and Masamichi is the one responsible for reigning him in whenever he pulls one of his stunts like publically taunting Principal . Despite the contrast in their personalities, Masamichi shares the same progressive attitude that Satoru does toward the students of Jujutsu High. On at least two occasions, the higher-ups have sentenced potential young sorcerers to death. Masamichi and Satoru decided to make  and  students rather than stick to tradition or the decisions made by the higher-ups. Suguru's betrayal devastated Masamichi as much as it did Satoru. Neither of them could make sense of what happened or Suguru's motivations at the time and were distraught that their comrade would suddenly go completely rogue. Masamichi didn't blame Satoru for not executing Suguru and even apologized for even asking why he didn't. \n\"\"When interviewing Yuji, he initially refused to allow him to become a student because Yuji's motivation was a dying request from his grandfather. However, becoming a sorcerer for someone else for any reason is unacceptable in Masamichi's opinion, even if it comes at the request of a family member. He asked Yuji if it would be his grandfather's fault if he were killed by a curse, a very harsh question. Yuji pointed out the horrible nature of the statement but Masamichi clarified that it's a teacher's job to make their students have realizations. His methods are unorthodox, but Masamichi prides himself on developing his students. Masamichi used one of his cursed corpses to attack Yuji, pressuring him to give a better answer. Masamichi claimed that no jujutsu sorcerer dies without regret but Yuji told him he didn't want to live with regrets either, which was a satisfactory response.\nMasamichi raising Panda as his own child.Masamichi tests the convictions of his students due to what happened with Suguru, which is likely Masamichi's biggest regret. While Gakuganji believed Yuji should've been executed because of the threat  presents, Masamichi argued on his behalf. Masamichi pointed out the lives Yuji has saved and his potential to be a great sorcerer. He knew regrets aren't limited to just the students and that Yuji will experience a lot of it. However, Masamichi believed that they should try and guide Yuji and put their regrets as adults to the side. They comedically agreed they needed to do something about Satoru first anyway.\nMasamichi using a cursed corpse to help Kusakabe's sister heal from her trauma.Masamichi has a few personality quirks that distinguish him from being an overly serious man. He has a comedic catchphrase, \"Goddamn!\" (in English), that he says whenever he's surprised by something. Masamichi is also known for liking cute stuff, which is in direct contrast to his sternness. His cursed corpses are essentially cute dolls, and Yuji met Masamichi while he was making some, confusing the new student. \nMasamichi's responsibility as a role model extends to his cursed corpses. He is essentially Panda's father and raised him throughout his youth. When Panda was still very young, Masamichi encouraged him revealing that he had two siblings inside of him that would lend him strength should he ever need it. Masamichi raised Panda into adolescence and enrolled him into Jujutsu High. The other students are aware of this relationship as Maki has mentioned that Panda is the principal's favorite.\nMasamichi willingly sacrifices himself to protect his secrets.Masamichi considers his own talent as a sorcerer to be a \"curse\". As the foremost practitioner of puppet jujutsu, Masamichi was able to develop fully independent cursed corpses. Upon creating Panda, Masamichi was restrained and interrogated about raising his own army. Since that point, Masamichi has kept his other creations a secret within a forest protected by Tengen. However, he broke his own rule in order to help 's sister deal with the loss of her son. Masamichi is a kind man who invented a cursed corpse with her son Takeru's soul information to help her cope, which Kusakabe is immensely grateful for. When facing execution following the Shibuya Incident, Masamichi was well aware his time was running out and that the higher-ups just wanted his formula for creating independent cursed corpses. Rather than expose his own secret, Masamichi allowed himself to be fatally injured by Gakuganji. Only in his last moments did Masamichi pass on his formula to his executioner, stating that it was \"a curse from me to you\".",
      "abilities": "Masamichi effortlessly exorcising a curse.: Masamichi was already a veteran grade 1 sorcerer by the time Satoru, Suguru, and Shoko were in their second year of high school. He was the foremost practitioner of puppet jujutsu, making him the most proficient user of cursed corpses of any sorcerer. He was the only one able to develop fully independent cursed corpses that retain their own cursed energy. Panda is Masamichi's finest creation, an abrupt mutated cursed corpse with three self-sustaining cores and emotions. \nThe potential threat of the creation of sentient cursed corpses proposed nearly lead the higher-ups to promote Masamichi to special grade and place an indefinite restriction on him. They were afraid he could effectively create his own army that requires no external support.\nMasamichi developed numerous cursed corpses capable of performing a variety of tasks. Some were for combat and others provided support or training for other sorcerers. While Masamichi's primary talent was crafting puppets, he was capable of exorcising cursed spirits on his own as well. He was likely a capable close range combatant, as he was the one who taught Panda to fight and was willing to fight a fellow sorcerer without the use of his cursed corpses. While he was defeated, Masamichi was able to injure Gakuganji and break his guitar before succumbing to his wounds.",

      "personality": "Eso lives for his brothers Kechizu and Choso, believing that the three of them are one. They existed together in isolation for over 150 years and only feel a connection to one another. Eso doesn't hate sorcerers and was willing enough to spare Nobara if she fled prior to their fight.

He enjoys striking posses and dominating others. Despite his welcoming demeanor, Eso has a dark secret he doesn't want anyone to know.

As Nobara is confused about what Eso's errand is, Eso says that he thought that the sorcerers were sent to retrieve Sukuna's finger too.\nWhen  retrieves the finger, Eso senses that the finger has exited the realm. Eso decides to head over to retrieve the finger, with Nobara following him. Nobara points out the weird way he is running, which Eso says that he has a complex about his back and that he will kill her if she sees his back.

Eso asks Yuji and Nobara if they wish to be killed faster, which Nobara responds by using her  technique on herself to inflict harm to the brothers. Eso thinks about Nobara's technique and how it won't be enough to kill him before she dies. When Yuji starts to attack Kechizu, Eso tries to help Kechizu but is stopped by Nobara. When Yuji and Nobara switchs targets, Eso thinks about the situation they are in and decides to not deactivate his technique. When Kechizu calls out to Eso, he remembers what their older brother told them and deactivates his technique. Eso and Yuji then start to fight, which Eso uses his Wing King technique on him. When Yuji uses Black Flash to blow off Eso's arm, Eso thinks about how Yuji was able to do that even through he had reinforced his arm with cursed energy before Yuji landed his attack. After seeing Kechizu injured by the same technique, Eso hopes that Kechizu is still alive. Eso then senses that Kechizu had died and apologizes to their older brother for not saving Kechizu.\nWhen a car suddenly drives past them, Eso take this chance to get on the car and take a hostage. As the car drives away, Eso plans to heal himself and get revenge on Yuji and Nobara for killing his brother. As Eso looks over to where Kechizu is, he notices Nobara and wonders what she is doing.

He also always sports a round scarf around his neck that matches his gi and brown boots. \nIn the anime, Choso has violet eyeshadow around his eyes and his hair is a light brown color.",
      "personality": "Choso is a very calm and reserved person who's fairly quiet and tends to fade into the background of social groups. He normally has a bored expression on his face and appears aloof and completely disassociated in most situations. \nChoso rage over the death of his younger brothers.Choso is half  but he doesn't have an inherent desire to attack people and doesn't even harbor any disdain toward . He's not cruel or vicious in any way and generally doesn't speak often unless it has to do with his family. In fact, Choso loved his human mother and the sorcerer who toyed with him was the only one to earn his hatred.\nDespite appearing to be a very disassociative person, Choso is very attached and protective of his brothers. Upon being incarnated, Choso told his two brothers that three of them lived only for one another and that they were all one.\nChoso clashing with Jogo over taking revenge on Yuji.With a bored expression on his face, Choso was going through the motions of a simple board game with Mahito and Pseudo-Geto when he learned Eso and Kechizu had perished, deeply upsetting him.  He agreed to fight alongside Mahito and Geto but ultimately only pursued the goal of avenging his brothers during the Shibuya Incident. \nEven during the  against , Choso barely committed himself to attacking Gojo and stayed far back out of his range the entire time, upsetting . He also clashed with Jogo's more abrasive personality over keeping Yuji alive to revive  because Choso wanted to kill the vessel outright to avenge his siblings. \nChoso assuming his duty to protect Yuji as one of his younger brothers.Choso earned the opportunity to take revenge on Yuji but could feel his impending death right before dealing the killing blow. It's a side effect of his composition as a Death Painting Womb and of his cursed technique. Choso can feel the death of his brothers and felt the same intense sensation from Yuji's impending death as he did from Eso and Kechizu's. \n\"\"Once Choso realized that Noritoshi Kamo survived by moving from body to body, he surmised that Yuji must be his relative through that connection. Choso was quick to deem him one of his younger brothers and align himself with him. He devoted all his strength to protecting Yuji for the remainder of their time in Shibuya and focused his vengeance on Kenjaku for manipulating him into hurting his little brother.  \nChoso takes immense pride in being the oldest of ten siblings and who he is as a person directly tied to this. He believes that he needs to protect his younger brothers and serve as a dependable example because that's what an elder brother does.Due to his family values and unconditional love for his siblings, Choso can't understand someone like . Naoya hates all of his older brothers because they are weaker than him. Choso argues that older siblings either present the road to travel or the one to avoid. He believes perhaps someone like Naoya is only strong because his brothers are weak. Unlike Naoya, Choso didn't have an older brother to show him the way so he always stumbled and made mistakes. Even so, Choso stands tall and walks the path ahead of his younger brothers and it is from this dedication that he draws strength.\nChoso drawing strength from his dedication to his younger siblings.Choso wants to kill his father Kenjaku for the sake of his family and has no issue sacrificing his life to do so. On the edge of defeat against Kenjaku, Choso refused to accept defeat because he felt as if his younger brothers were pushing him through the pain and telling him to fight on. He refused to accept Kenjaku's disinterest in them and used moves inspired by each of them to do his best to commit patricide. \nAlthough Choso has been accepted by Yuji, he still regrets what happened with Eso and Kechizu. He feels responsible for the death of his younger brothers and fears that Yuji will be left alone because of his older brother's foolish choices. Choso initially decided to live as curses because he knew Eso and Kechizu wouldn't be accepted by humanity. Choso now feels as if that was the easy path which in turn ruined a future where the four of them were destined to all fight together. He was very emotional when admitting this to Yuki, who eventually told him to die as a curse so he can live on as a human alongside Yuji. Despite their short time together, Choso was distraught over Yuki's death and did his best to honor her legacy by passing her notes onto Yuji.",
      "abilities": "Choso wielding Blood Manipulation with  enough exceptional skill to surprise a fellow user.: Choso is ranked special grade and is exceptionally powerful even by cursed spirit standards. While still existing as a cursed object, Choso was intelligent and self-aware, allowing him to hone his cursed techniques for 150 years. By the time he was incarnated, Choso had already mastered Blood Manipulation to a level that far surpasses the current . \nDuring his minimal role in the  to seal Satoru Gojo, Choso showcased a host of different Blood Manipulation techniques. None of them could breach Gojo's Infinity, but they were also used to slaughter tons of non-sorcerers to put him at a further disadvantage.       \nChoso overcoming Yuji's superior close combat prowess.In addition to jujutsu, Choso also excels in taijutsu, capable of standing up against a master martial artist like Yuji. Using his whit alongside a host of techniques to contend with Yuji's strength, Choso overcame his opponent to the degree that he could have ended his life. This is even after  helped the  student put the blood manipulator in a situation where he couldn't control it outside his body. \nDespite exhausting himself during the Shibuya Incident, Choso continued to fight on and clashed with Kenjaku in order to help Yuji. Although Kenjaku escaped mostly unscathed, his partner  was hit by Choso's  technique and poisoned. A sorcerer of Uraume's caliber was strong enough to completely immobilize all Yuji's allies. Uraume was able to freeze Choso as well, but after  rescued everyone from Uraume's , enough time had passed for Choso's poison to take effect. \nChoso turning the tide of battle back against Naoya.Naoya Zenin, a special grade 1 sorcerer and inheritor of the former head of the 's , is another close combat fighter that Choso battled and defeated. Choso was quickly able to deduce that Naoya was a speed type and there was a trick to it hidden within his cursed technique. \nWhile Choso was still outclassed by Naoya's speed and suffered a one-sided beating at the beginning of their fight, he managed to tough it out thanks to his physical endurance and unwavering willingness to defend his little brother. Although Naoya managed to injure the Death Painting Womb and slice him open, Choso turned his wound into an advantage and once again overcame Naoya by using different Blood Manipulation moves in a variety of clever ways.\nChoso holding out against Kenjaku using Blood Manipulation in inventive ways.Out of a group of sorcerers, Choso was one of the three Tengen asked to guard them against Kenjaku. Despite losing to Kenjaku in the end, Choso fought strategically with Yuki and Tengen to nearly achieve victory, fulfilling his role the best he possibly could. Choso was the first to fight Kenjkau and his goal was to draw out his father's hidden abilities. He struggled against solely Cursed Spirit Manipulation at first, and weak cursed spirits at that. Choso was unable to effectively counterattack until he used Blood Manipulation in inventive ways by taking inspiration from his brothers. Kenjaku overpowered Choso with by low-grade cursed spirits reinforced with his cursed energy but Choso's clever use of blood nearly landed an attack that not even he, a sorcerer with centuries of experience, saw coming. Choso successfully forced Kenjaku to reveal an innate technique other Cursed Spirit Manipulation and earned Yuki's praise. \nChoso and Yuki pressuring Kenjaku while injured.Choso surprised Kenjaku a second time when he re-entered the fray after allowing Yuki to take over. Despite his injuries, Choso continued to play a pivotal role in the fight, rescuing Yuki and ambushing Kenjaku in one fell swoop.  Choso understood it had to be Yuki to deal a decisive blow and fought alongside her shikigami to buy her time to heal herself. This allowed them to take the momentum back which again impressed Yuki, who initially believed Choso would hold her back if they fought together. \n: Choso has existed for one-hundred and fifty years and one of his greatest weapons is his incredible level of wisdom. His mastery over Blood Manipulation has allowed Choso the freedom to experiment and utilize its abilities in ways that are all unique to him. He applies the technique in many different ways during battle to swing the tide in his favor. \nChoso predicted Yuji's attack and directed it to a hardened section of his body.When the ability to manipulate blood outside his body was stripped from him, Choso instinctively focused on controlling the blood inside him in spite of his minimal battle experience. Choso knew he couldn't physically compete with Yuji, so he used Flowing Red Scale: Stack to even the odds. Although Yuji began to gain the upper hand in close combat, Choso hid some blood in his hand to ensure it didn't dissolve and shot a  through his robe to hide the projectile that successfully pierced Yuji's liver. \nChoso focusing Flowing Red Scale: Stack in his eyes to adjust to Naoya's speed.After being on the receiving end of three of Yuji's superpowered punches, Choso quickly assessed the heavy damaged he received and determined that he was a severe threat. He risked thrombosis and hardened blood within his body and used it to block what could've been Yuji's fight-ending blow. Yuji believed that Choso wouldn't think he would use his left hand because he injured it early in the fight. However, not only did Choso predict he would use his left hand, but he also correctly foresaw exactly where he would try to land that punch.  Choso hardened his blood to protect his body in the perfect spot and was able to defeat Yuji as a direct result of his tactical prowess.  \nWhen faced with the responsibility of protecting Yuji against an impossible opponent like Yuta Okkotsu, Choso was able to form a solid plan in a very short amount of time. Although Choso was ultimately thwarted, he wanted to block off Yuta and allow Yuji to escape while also dealing with Noaya so the speed-type couldn't give chase. \nChoso using a wave of blood and Slicing Exorcism to counter Naoya's speed by breaking his line of sight.Once Choso realized he was at a disadvantage, he focused Flowing Red Scale: Stack in his eyes to raise his dynamic visual acuity in order to track Naoya's speed. He also noticed that Naoya was familiar with Blood Manipulation and got the Zenin clan sorcerer to walk right into , a Choso original Naoya's clan would have no knowledge of.\nChoso successfully executing his plan to ambush Kenjaku.Choso's wise and coolheaded nature pairs well with his overall intellect. He is a formidable strategist, best displayed when he helped create the best possible plan to combat Kenjaku with Yuki and Tengen. Choso pointed out that Kenjaku wouldn't open his domain against Yuki if he knew someone else was lying in wait. The plan was altered to use Choso to draw out Kenjaku's cursed techniques and convincingly remove himself from the fight. This was ultimately successful despite a few mishaps, as Kenjaku didn't expect Choso's return to the fight and was caught completely off guard by his ambush.\nChoso's intelligence also extends to practical situations that don't include combat. When faced with the obstacle of getting past Tengen's concealing barrier, Choso had the clever idea of copying how Mahito invaded during the . The cursed warehouse storing cursed objects such as the Death Painting Womb lies between Tengen's doors and the Tombs of the Star. By tracking the presence of his six brothers, Choso can guess the one correct door out of thousands to breach Tengen's barrier. \nAn exhausted Choso showcasing his taijutsu skill and toughness by fighting Kenjaku at the end of Shibuya Incident.: As previously stated, Choso excels in unarmed combat and was able to overpower two powerful combatants that fight exclusively at close range, Yuji and Naoya. Enhanced by his cursed techniques, Choso's martial arts is a threat that can even contend with the likes of Yuji. Enhanced by Blood manipulation, Choso was able to parry and counter Yuji's martial arts with his own. \nChoso's toughness and mental fortitude on display.: As noted by Naoya Zenin, Choso is exceptionally tough. He was able to withstand multiple hits from Yuji, who possesses superhuman strength enhanced with cursed energy and masterful precision in his martial arts technique. The Death Painting Womb was also on the receiving end of consecutive blows hits from Noaya that carried the momentum from him moving at blistering speeds. In both hard-fought battles, Choso was able to endure and come out on top. Choso continued to press on even after his lengthy duel with Yuji as a testament to his stamina as well. \nChoso received his most brutal beating fighting one-on-one against Kenjaku. He was severely injured by an onslaught from Cursed Spirit Manipulation but used the image of his brothers to persevere and continue fighting. Even after thoroughly expending himself, Choso returned to ambush Kenjaku and fought effectively alongside Yuki until he was eventually incapacitated. Even then, Choso still activated one last cursed technique in an attempt to stop Kenjaku. \n: Choso and his brothers were all created as an experiment by Kenjaku to exceed the bounds of cursed energy. Death Painting Wombs were meant to be something more than humans and cursed spirits. Choso is constantly controlling his own blood with cursed energy and his composition as a Death Painting Womb also allows him to produce more of it at will. Choso was able to do so constantly throughout all the conflicts in Shibuya and its aftermath without ever coming close to exhausting his reserves. Not only does Choso possess delicate control over his cursed energy to fuel his techniques with precision, but he can also charge each and every one of them with tremendous power. Noritoshi Kamo was astounded by the amount of concentrated cursed energy Choso put into his Convergence.\n: Like Eso and Kechizu, Choso's blood is also poisonous, something he thinks should be obvious. It takes effect fairly quickly and drains its victim's stamina, causing them to seat find themselves short of breath. Uraume's Ice Formation technique was even forcibly disengaged when the poison took effect on them. Naoya was also wounded by Choso and his body began to reject the fully fleshed curse's non-human blood, causing him to vomit.\n: The Kamo ancestor controlled by Kenjaku mixed his blood with the human and cursed spirit that resulted in the Death Painting Wombs. This allowed Choso to inherit Blood Manipulation and train it to its fullest extent. Choso is a master constantly using this technique to manipulate his own blood and utilizes it in nearly every facet of his combat arsenal.",

While fighting, Toji wears a tight-fitting short sleeve shirt, sports tan baggy training pants with a black belt weaved through the waist and black martial arts slippers. While still a member of the Zenin family, Toji wore a dark-colored  over a black .",
      "personality": "Toji's cold and lax demeanor, unable to remember who \"Megumi\" is when asked about him.Toji is a cool-headed, confident man who makes a living using his skills and does not sweat the small stuff. He appears to enjoy insightful conversation with others as long as it somehow pertains to himself and can trade witty banter with the highly sarcastic likes of Satoru Gojo. Upon meeting, Satoru asked Toji if they had met before. Toji, on the other hand, reassured him that he was not the type to recall a random man either. In battle, Toji has a crazed expression as if he's lost in the thrill of the fight, but he's always maintaining a cool and calculated head and plotting his next move. \nToji is an assassin who's garnered the name \"Sorcerer Killer\" and spends his time gambling between assignments from shady clients. He married a woman and left her just as quickly, leaving his newborn child behind without knowing their gender and eventually forgot their name. Toji even planned on selling Megumi to the Zenin family he had left behind, exploiting the young Megumi for the cursed technique he would eventually inherit.\nToji remaining confident even in the face of a dangerous threat.Toji doesn't question his client's motives as long as the money is right and generally doesn't do any extra work for free. He's bold and dangerously calculated in his strategies, using his jujutsu knowledge to outwit even the most prophesized sorcerers. This garnered him a reputation large enough to attract the attention of the wealthy Time Vessel Association for such an important job that could ensure their future. While he thought the religious members of the organization were crazy, he got along well enough with their middleman to invite him to eat. \nToji ignoring his survival instincts for a chance to discredit the jujutsu society that rejected him.As a non-sorcerer raised in the Zenin family who values cursed techniques above all, Toji is a man who has suffered due to the interests of the sorcerer clans in a very similar manner to . His evil actions result from his dejection towards the jujutsu world as he attempts to spite it. Born without cursed energy, Toji eventually left the Zenin family and married a woman, taking her name \"Fushiguro\". Her kindness helped Toji change his ways. He stopped gambling and hunting sorcerers and it's likely her influence stopped Toji from taking revenge on the Zenin clan. However, after her death, Toji reverted back to his old, cold, self. He sold their son to the Zenin family because he believed in young Megumi's potential to be a real sorcerer, naming him \"Megumi\" because it means blessings. \nToji completed his final mission for the Time Vessel Association and should have cut and run when faced with a rejuvenated Satoru Gojo. However, due to his disdain for the jujutsu world and the sorcerer families, Toji chose to try and cut down the most gifted sorcerer in the world as another way to spite them all. Unfortunately, this pride cost Toji his life. Unable to look past his demons, he deviated from his natural instincts and ignored the uneasiness plaguing him during the fight. \nKeeping up with his cold persona, Toji chose not to utter any final words at first. In his last moments, he thought of his ex-wife and their son, so he decided to tell Satoru that Megumi would be sold into the Zenin family in a few years. This would eventually lead to Satoru becoming a close mentor for Megumi in the future as well as granting Megumi a chance to work as a jujutsu sorcerer.\nToji stops himself from being used as a weapon against his son.'s  returned Toji's soul from the dead, turning him into a walking manifestation of carnage. He would attack anything in his path, mostly focused on crushing the strongest opponent available. While endangering his own son with this outburst of aggression, Toji chose to return to death by committing suicide to protect him. He also did so without ever revealing their connection to each other. Instead, with his final words, Toji expresses that he's glad to hear that Megumi refers to himself as a Fushiguro instead of a Zenin.",
      "abilities": "Toji's skills and careful planning allow him to get past the legendary Six Eyes.: While Toji is technically a non-curse user with no innate talent for jujutsu, he was one of the most elite fighters in the jujutsu world when he was alive. With innate physical prowess far superior to all others in his path, Toji contended with the most dangerous and highly ranked jujutsu practitioners this era had to offer. \nToji cutting down Satoru Gojo, the most powerful sorcerer alive, in brutal fashion.He was able to defeat the strongest jujutsu sorcerers at the time without sustaining any injuries beyond a small cut around the ear, one of which was a young Satoru Gojo, a prodigy who possessed the  and  cursed technique. The other was the curse manipulator , a powerful grade 1 sorcerer that would reach special grade a year later. Toji was able to effortlessly take down Suguru along with several of his strongest cursed spirits. Toji referred to Suguru's abilities as rabble compared to his own strength.\nToji used the jujutsu knowledge from the Zenin family and turned it against sorcerers, earning him the moniker of \"Sorcerer Killer.\" During the Star Plasma Vessel Escort Mission, an assignment given to the two strongest sorcerers by , Toji was hired by the Time Vessel Association to assassinate the Star Plasma Vessel. Toji was able to completely derail the escort through a series of tactical moves over a few days. This wore down the escort team and lured them into a false sense of security before he abruptly made his move. \nToji exorcising powerful curses with a single stroke of his blade.Toji's elaborate planning led to him successfully pulling off a surprise attack on a user of the prestigious , ocular jujutsu that grants god-like perception. Toji took full advantage of his lack of cursed energy, making him the perfect assassin thanks to his status as an \"invisible man\". The culmination of all Toji's talents allowed him to successfully defeat the Star Plasma Vessel's escort team and assassinate the girl, completing his assignment while nearly killing both of Jujutsu High's most blessed sorcerers in the process. \nToji was only defeated when he pitted his pure physical prowess against the awakened  technique wielded by Satoru Gojo. Even in the face of this power, Toji was able to create clever ways to combat the abilities of the Limitless that were known to the Zenin family. Only the secret Hollow Purple technique was powerful enough to put down Toji once and for all. \nToji cutting down Suguru Geto in short order., another special grade sorcerer, found that Toji was the only case where a Heavenly Restriction has eradicated someone's cursed energy completely. By eliminating all cursed energy, Toji's body was sharpened to the point where he developed a resistance to curses and could detect them with his highly refined five senses. This also allowed him to dominate and utilize a cursed spirit capable of storing his wide arsenal of weapons. Yuki considered him to be truly superhuman and told Suguru that he shouldn't be ashamed to have lost to him in a fight. \nWhen resurrected by Granny Ogami's Séance Technique, Toji's body was able to overwrite her technique and acted purely on fighting instinct. At the start of his out-of-control rampage, Toji killed Ogami with a single blow and nearly beat grade 2 sorcerer, , to death with his bare hands. \nToji brutalizing Dagon without sustaining a single injury.He also took on a special grade cursed spirit, , and single-handledly dominated him. Dagon was a powerful curse that Maki and grade 1 sorcerers  and  could not defeat together. In comparison, Toji made exorcising Dagon look effortless, cementing his own status undeniably on the level of that of a special grade.\nShortly afterward, Toji confronted Megumi, and the latter compared Toji to a fully realized Maki. He also recognized Toji as a \"monster\" capable of taking out a special grade cursed spirit and assessed his  were no match for him. If Toji had not chosen to sacrifice himself, Megumi, too would have been another victim of Toji's rampage. \nToji using his cursed spirit's ability to store his weapons.: The Sorcerer Killer is capable of employing a wide variety of weapons in battle. His entire fighting style is based around using weapons to substitute for jujutsu. He keeps a vast arsenal in his cursed spirit, allowing him to efficiently switch weapons out based on necessity. \nToji has used non-cursed tools such as swords to perform a sneak attack, so no cursed energy will be detected. Armed with a normal handgun, he's also an expert marksmen with extremely precise aim.\nToji's versatile weapon dexterity in action.The Sorcerer Killer can counter jujutsu users because he is also a master of wielding cursed tools. He's used a cursed tool broadsword to counter and slice open giant cursed spirits. Toji has employed knives and daggers, sometimes one in each hand. Additionally he employs his special grade cursed tool: The Inverted Spear of Heaven with a mastery worthy of that ranking. He could capitalize on the dagger's powerful nullification technique to negate even the most powerful sorcerer's abilities. \nToji successfully complements his physical gifts with high adaptability and dexterity with all his weapons. By attaching a chain to the Inverted Spear of Heaven, Toji changed his entire fighting style to suit a long ranged battle. When he first confronted Dagon, Toji took , a weapon that Megumi stated was difficult to use, from Maki and used it to its maximum potential. \n: Thanks to his Heavenly Restriction, Toji's lack of cursed energy resulted in his five senses being heightened to their absolute peak. He was able to see curses and jujutsu with just his elevated senses and even developed a resistance to them. This also allowed Toji to track sorcerers without the use of residuals, as he was able to follow human footprints and odors. \n: Toji possesses a superhuman degree of physical strength, enough so to effortlessly yank Playful Cloud from Maki's hands, another person with great physical gifts. Using Playful Cloud, a tool that depends on physical strength, Toji was able to easily smash through Dagon's hardest shikigami. With another cursed tool, he was able to cut through Suguru's toughest curse, and used his bare hands to beat Takuma Ino's face so badly he almost died. \nToji's superhuman agility.: Toji has been noted to have superhuman speed, so much so that his opponents can't read his moves. He could dodge Satoru's cursed technique Lapse: Blue, completely avoiding the field of attraction before Satoru even realized it. Megumi also stated that Toji was ridiculously fast, even faster than Sukuna with three fingers. In their fight, Toji could avoid a point-blank stabbing attack despite getting his foot caught in Megumi's shadow, thanks to incredible agility and reflexes. He also stated that seeing Toji while he moves is near impossible and was impressed his speed rivaled that of Sukuna's without cursed energy.\nToji moving quickly and unpredictably.Toji's speed was enough to easily counter Suguru's curses in exchange. He quickly avoided Suguru's Rainbow Dragon by moving on top of a building despite the swift curse in front of him. His reflexes were also quick enough to counter 's scissor blades, which were already so close to him that they cut his flesh when he first noticed them. As soon as Suguru came in close range, Toji cut him and the Imaginary Vengeful Curse down in a flash.\nInside Dagon's Domain, Toji was so fast that he could run on water like it was nothing, shocking the special grade. He only got faster as their fight went on, allowing him to plow through the endless stream of shikigamis with ease.\n: When it came to his assignments, Toji approached his missions with careful calculation, caution, and patience. Toji has retained a plethora of information from being a member of the Zenin family, including understanding the workings of the Limitless and the Six Eyes. \nToji quickly recognizes he's been caught in Kuchisake-Onna's Domain and analyzes her abilities.Using this information, Toji could plot out a way to slowly wear down Satoru and his escort team. With connections to the curse user community and funds from the Star Religious Group, Toji put a bounty on the Star Plasma Vessel's head. By posting it on a website for curse users with a time limit, evil sorcerers flocked to collect the bounty. He knew they'd be unable to win, so this was free labor, a smart way to use his resources. The time limit also worked in his favor, luring Satoru into lowering his guard once the mission was over. Once Satoru deactivated the Infinity, the Sorcerer Killer immediately acted and only then jumped in to fight the sorcerer directly. \nToji is clever in battle and quick to analyze his opponent's abilities. He correctly assumed Suguru's technique early in their battle. He quickly recognized his 's ability within her Domain. He also came up with several ways to counter Satoru's Limitless in their final bout. When he was brought back by Ogami, Toji instantly created a theory that was correct on how exactly he was able to keep his individuality despite his technique.\n: The trade-off for Toji's complete lack of cursed energy is his immense physical prowess. While it has been noted that several people have had Heavenly Restrictions that bring their cursed energy to normal levels, Toji is the only case where it has erased the person's cursed energy completely. By eliminating all cursed energy, Toji's body became sharpened to a point where his five senses reached his pinnacle, and he could freely interact with curses.\nWhen Granny Ogami summoned the information of Toji's body for her Séance Technique, she could not control him because his heavenly gifted body overwrites her grandchild's soul's information. Furthermore, his body doesn't take up cursed energy, allowing Toji to be resurrected for an unprecedented amount of time.\nEquipmentThe  was one of Toji's primary cursed tools. It was a large Japanese broadsword with a fur tsuba and a dark handle. It bypasses physical toughness and cuts directly at the soul. Coupled with Toji's physical talent, this weapon was able to cut through several of Suguru's curses, including the Rainbow Dragon, which had the hardest skin among all his curses. This weapon is worth five hundred million yen.\nThe  is a special grade cursed tool with the ability to completely nullify cursed techniques on contact. It uses an imbued cursed technique fueled by foreign cursed energy. He used this to force the stoppage of the Infinity technique, completely bypassing the nearly impenetrable Limitless.\nThe  is a mysterious cursed tool that can keep extending as long as the user doesn't allow the back end to be visible. Toji hides the end of the chain in his curse's mouth. He connected the Inverted Spear of Heaven to the endless chain to create a kusarigama-like weapon, allowing him to use the Inverted Spear of Heaven from long range.",

Kenjaku released Kurourushi so the cursed spirit could compete at an elite level in the Culling Game. \nDespite generally acting on the instinct of satisfying an endless appetite, Kurourushi is a relatively intelligent creature compared to most cursed spirits. While not to the degree of the unregistered special grades like , ,  or , Kurourushi can speak and communicate clearly. Kurourushi understood its own status within the Culling Game and collected fifty-two before entering a deadlock with the most powerful players in the Sendai Colony. The cockroach curse was intelligent enough to understand that  would've been an unfavorable matchup and decided to enter a dormant state. Kurourushi also prepared for the worst by creating an offspring that would inherit its cursed energy in the event of an exorcism. \nKurourushi's cursed roaches targetting humans for consumption.Dhruv's defeat caused Kurourushi to awaken in a state of starvation. Its bottomless hunger immediately lashed out and used swarms of cursed cockroaches to devour any humans in the vicinity. When Yuta Okkotsu stopped Kurourushi's swarm, its instincts led it to try and devour the special grade sorcerer. \nKurourushi nearly devours Yuta, a special grade sorcerer.Kurourushi used its ability to manipulate large swarms of cockroaches well in tandem with wielding the Festering Life Sword. It could balance itself on a twister made of flying cockroaches and cast cursed techniques from a distance. Kurourushi used this tactic to distract Yuta with a swarm before impairing his vision with its Earthen Insect Trance technique from behind. This created the opening Kurourushi needed to make effective use of the Festering Life Sword. Kurourushi landed consecutive blows on Yuta and was poised to devour him, the prodigal sorcerer second only to Satoru Gojo. \nKurourushi proving to be a bad matchup for Takako Uro.Kurourushi withstood Yuta's reinforced  and swordplay but its body was completely compromised by his . At the last moment before Kurourushi ate Yuta, the sorcerer bit the cockroach curse and delivered a mouth-to-mouth blast of reverse cursed energy. After the parent's exorcism, the cursed energy of fear throughout Japan was poured into the child. Even after Kurourushi the Culling Game player perished, the cursed spirit still thrived. \n, an exceptionally strong player, was at a disadvantage against Kurourushi and considered it a particularly nasty opponent. She was displeased when Kurourushi became active again after Dhruv fell and didn't break the stalemate in the Colony until the parent was exorcised. Kurourushi's reappearance was such a threat that Uro's focus left her unguarded against Yuta. Uro was vulnerable after she used  and Kurourushi severed her arm with the Festering Life Sword. However, Kurourushi could not withstand a direct hit from 's  and was ultimately exorcised by a consecutive blast of reverse cursed energy.  \nEquipment",

He also wore a pair of calf length olive green pants and off-white sneakers with black laces and golden soles and toes. \nLater on, after his 's death, he wore one of her black jackets in mourning.",
      "personality": "Junpei is a reserved and apathetic individual with a distaste for other people. He has very negative views of people and society as a whole. If there existed a button that would kill everyone he hates, he wouldn't press it. However, if there was a button that would kill everyone who hated him, he'd press it without hesitation. He claims that he feels indifferent towards people and believes that it's no worse than hating them. \nJunpei's indifferent towards other humans because he expects them to be evil, so even people's deaths don't seem to affect him. This is due to all the trauma he received from being bullied and rejected in his life. He has always been a recluse, but Junpei loves movies and tried to start his own club at school. It was unfortunately taken over by bullies who burned Junpei while nobody did anything to help him or reprimand his assaulters.\nDespite being a normal student, Junpei's dejected attitude made him easy for Mahito to manipulate. Mahito fed into Junpei's darkness and encouraged him to take his indifference a step further into hate and revenge. This resulted in a shortsightedness that made Junpei unable to see Mahito for what he truly was.\nYuji, someone else who is around Junpei's age who's interested in movies, became one of Junpei's only friends. Even after Junpei had rejected all those around him, Yuji was able to begin to bring Junpei out of his troubled mindset.\nSynopsisJunpei's father and mother are divorced, he was raised by his mother and had a pretty standard upbringing. However, he was bullied by several of his school mates, with  being one of them. In one such instance, the end result caused him to end up with cigarette burn scars on his forehead.\nJunpei learns about Mahito's twisted experiments.At the Kinema Cinema while watching a movie, Junpei notices the three boys sitting in the front row and recognizes them as three of the students at his school who bullied him in the past. He becomes increasingly annoyed by their incessant chatter and finds himself unable to concentrate on the film. Suddenly, Mahito appears and kills all three students by distorting their heads with his ability. Mahito leaves the theater soon after but Junpei gives chase and manages to catch up to him. He asks the mysterious man before him if he was the one who did it, but Mahito replies with a question and asks Junpei if those boys were special to him. Recalling the horrible treatment he endured, Junpei becomes enraged and asks Mahito if he can accomplish the same feat.\nJunpei follows Mahito to his base of operations in the sewer, where they have a conversation about what cursed spirits are. Junpei asks what kind of cursed spirit Mahito is and he replies that he's a spirit that was created from the hatred of people towards each other. They continue their conversation, during which Mahito shows Junpei the experiments that he's done on humans so far, specifically showing Junpei the tests he's conducted to find out how large a human can get but also how small a human can become as well.\nJunpei encounters Yuji.Later, Junpei is walking home and finds his teacher, , sitting on the steps in front of his house. When Sotomura starts to aggravate Junpei, he motions to activate his power but is stopped by the timely arrival of Yuji. After Yuji creates a distraction and gets rid of Sotomura, Junpei and Yuji head off to have a chat. When they reach a river bed, Yuji asks about the theater incident. Junpei however covers for Mahito and claims that he didn't notice anything of importance at the time and that he could only begin to see curses fairly recently. The two then reach the topic of films after Yuji asks Junpei what movie he went to see and they discover that they have similar tastes in film. When Junpei's mother, Nagi approaches them shortly after, he introduces Yuji to her and she invites him over for dinner. After dinner, Nagi falls asleep, Junpei asks Yuji what his mother is like to which Yuji nonchalantly replies that he never knew her but faintly remembers his dad. They then discuss what would Yuji do if he had to kill a person like a bad sorcerer but Yuji is adamant that he does not want to end another's life because once he crosses that threshold, the value of life becomes ambiguous and he might not even know the true value of those he cherishes afterwards. After Yuji leaves, Junpei does some introspection and comes to the realization that even though he is of the belief that people do not have hearts, he could not kill someone as it would taint his soul.\nJunpei strikes Shota.After Junpei's mother is killed as a result of a curse being attracted to one of Sukuna's fingers, Mahito manipulates Junpei into believing that Shota was the one responsible for it when it was in fact Mahito who planted the appendage in Junpei's house. With feelings of despair and grief still swarming his heart, Junpei goes to school and uses his power to knock out most of the students during the morning assembly. Sotomura collapses in shock besides a student and tries to shake them awake, bewildered as to what is happening before his eyes. Junpei appears before him and reassures him that they will not die before turning to Shota, asking him if he was indeed the one who left  at his house.\nUnsatisfied with his lack of response, Junpei corners Shota and begins to slowly torture him, starting with partially disintegrating his left arm. Shota tries to apologize but his voice is distorted from all the blood in his throat. Junpei is not swayed by this in the slightest, however, before his attack turns fatal, Yuji shows up and stops him.\nJunpei lashes out against Yuji.Junpei and Yuji engage in combat throughout the school. Junpei tells Yuji he has no right to interfere with his business but Yuji refuses, stating that that is not his decision to make. Yuji forcefully grabs Junpei and tosses him outside through a window and Junpei expresses his frustration at the fact that his Moon Dregs poison is having no apparent effect on his opponent. Junpei regains his footing and tries to counter attack but he is easily overpowered and Yuji punches him straight into the building. Yuji tries to reason with Junpei once again and expresses understanding that he might have his own reasons for his actions but demands to know how he can say something like humans have no hearts to his mother's face. Junpei begins to crack and Yuji is taken aback by his pained expression as he asks Yuji if he and his mom were cursed by other people's hearts. \nJunpei lashes out and is shocked when Yuji makes no move to defend or dodge and instead chooses to take his attack. Yuji apologizes and asks him to explain what happened. After being told the truth, Yuji is left heartbroken and asks Junpei to join him at the technical college where he would be able to meet a great set of wonderful people who he can rely on, reassuring him that they will definitely find the person who cursed his mom and punish them.\nMahito transforms Junpei using Idle Transfiguration.However, their moment of reconciliation is abruptly cut short as Mahito suddenly appears behind them on the stairwell, much to Yuji and Junpei's surprise. Yuji asks Mahito who he is, but the man ignores his question and simply begins with a greeting, referring to Yuji as \"Sukuna's vessel\" before restraining him with his left arm. Yuji screams for Junpei to run away but Junpei, still believing the façade he was shown, stays and tries to mediate the escalating situation, claiming that Mahito was in fact not a bad person. However as he says these words, images of Mahito's experiments flash in his mind which causes Junpei's voice to die in his throat as he seemingly realizes that he's made a grave mistake. Mahito places a hand on the now shaken Junpei's shoulders and taunts him, basically calling him an impulsive fool who is next in line in stupidity after the same people he liked to make fun of.\nJunpei in his transfigured state.But before Junpei can even blink, Mahito uses his Idle Transfiguration technique and transforms Junpei into one of his many ex-human abominations. Yuji is so shocked he is unable to react and the now transfigured Junpei gets a hit in, but Yuji ignores the pain and instead focuses on trying to wake Junpei up. Desperate and out of options, he tries to turn to Sukuna for help but is swiftly denied and mocked by Sukuna himself as well as Mahito.\nYuji, now at a loss for words, can do nothing more but watch as Junpei slumps to the ground, grasping at his clothes and faintly asking \"...Why...?\" before falling to the ground and dying.",
      "abilities": ": Prior to meeting Mahito, Junpei was weak. He was an average non-sorcerer who was constantly picked on and bullied. Mahito altered Junpei and turned him into a sorcerer, allowing Junpei to get his revenge. To his peers, it looked as if Junpei gained psychic powers they could not perceive. They were unable to view Junpei's jujutsu and Shota Ito suffered a wrath he couldn't even see. Junpei gained the ability to summon a fairly strong shikigami. This allowed him to even put up a fight against Yuji, who was a relatively new sorcerer at the time.",

At times he can appear cheerful, playful, and even charming, but he is a manipulative, and deeply egotistical individual who will stop at nothing to further his ambitions regardless of who he harms.\nKenjaku's condescending nature beneath his cheerful demeanour, even toward his own allies.While Kenjaku is uncaring and aloof when it comes to things that disinterest him, he's very talkative when it comes to himself or his interests. Kenjaku has a habit of going on long monologues and enjoys drawing out small talk without anyone, even his enemies. This can vary from casually educating someone on the state of the world or ruthlessly taunting his opponents. Kenjaku's demeanor is often optimistic and outspoken, but it carries an aura of condescension, which often infuriates those he is talking to, even his allies.  in particular finds Kenjaku annoying and doesn't enjoy his company at all despite them being longtime comrades.

Even when faced with , Kenjaku made jokes and casually taunted him as if Satoru didn't confront him with the intent to kill.\nKenjaku highlighting his success to taunt his enemies.Kenjaku doesn't intentionally intimidate anyone or control people through fear to get them to serve his interests. He manipulates them in clever ways using his charm to convince them they share a common goal. The mighty , the calamity of aggression that disregards all else, worked with Kenjaku to split his soul into twenty cursed objects after death. Sukuna even protected Kenjaku from Satoru Gojo and agreed not to fight him before their agreement was concluded. While Kenjaku's manipulative tactics don't rely on fear-mongering, they don't rely on loyalty or respectful leadership either. Kenjaku simply knows how to play people and use their desires for his own ends. Kenjaku convinced hundreds of sorcerers over hundreds of years to join the Culling Game as a second chance at life, a situation they could thrive in as blood-thirsty warriors. Several curse users in Shibuya worked with Kenjaku in order to rid themselves of Satoru Gojo. In the case where an entity Kenjaku wants to use doesn't share an enemy or an objective, he will fabricate one. He went to a foreign power in the United States military and convinced them to invade Japan under the guise of abducting sorcerers to study cursed energy as a potentially sustainable resource. In reality, he tricked them into entering the Culling Game's colonies only to sacrifice their soldiers for his plan.\nKenjaku manipulating entire governments to serve his interests.Kenjaku worked with 's group of cursed spirits to work with him toward a world ruled by curses. While this isn't exactly what Kenjaku desires, his own interests aligned with theirs at the time. He gave them advice, spent time playing games with them, and supported Mahito and the others. However, Kenjaku believes himself superior to cursed spirits and was completely indifferent to the demise of Mahito's group in Shibuya. His only regret was not being able to absorb  before his death. Kenjaku only stopped Yuji from exorcising Mahito so that he could absorb him and even thanked him for drawing out Mahito's strength.\n — Kenjaku's tendency to hold a one-sided conversation.Kenjaku's self-centered tendencies are driven by his boundless curiosity. Even after existing for hundreds of years, he's fascinated by the possibilities presented by cursed energy. He essentially wants to know the true potential of cursed energy in the form of a being and believes he can discover it by creating uncontrollable chaos. This is why he created the Death Womb Paintings only to discard them when he was disappointed with their \"normal\" outcome. He has no interest in anything unrelated to his ultimate goal and only looks to build toward his endgame. Never missing an opportunity to flaunt his ideals, Kenjaku discussed his goal with Yuki and Choso on two separate occasions. Kenjaku told Yuki Tsukumo that humanity's future lay in optimizing cursed energy and that, unlike Suguru Geto, he doesn't desire a world without cursed spirits. He admitted to Choso that he plans on merging the citizens of Japan into one entity simply because it seems like fun. He compared it to being a toddler holding a crayon with a blank piece of paper. Kenjaku even admitted that if that entity ended up being a funny face, that would be hilarious to him.\nKenjaku proudly admitting his chaotic schemes are all for his entertainment. and Kenjaku used to be friends at some point but now Kenjaku considers the former a shut-in. He doesn't believe that's any way to exist and claims that he's truly lived by comparison. Having lived across a thousand years of conflicts and alliances, Kenjaku perceives the world as cursed one. He has profound contempt for all modern social structures, people, and philosophies that favor passivity and maintaining the status quo. He feels as if Japanese people incorrectly believe their lives are stable when in reality they're always on the brink of ruin. He knows not everyone will risk their lives while others are willing to die at any time without any hope for the future.

      "abilities": "Kenjaku weilding Cursed Spirit Manipulation with as much expertise as Suguru Geto.: Kenjaku is an ancient sorcerer who has accumulated a wealth of -related knowledge and experience over the course of a thousand years. His advanced understanding of jujutsu sorcery is second to none with numerous feats that display his talent. As Noritoshi Kamo, Kenjaku invented the Cursed Womb: Death Paintings and became known as the evilest curse user in history. He is the only person who knows how to turn a sorcerer into a  after death, something not even Sukuna knew how to do during the Heian Era. He is also the second most powerful barrier user after Tengen, recognized as one of few sorcerers who can match them in barrier techniques. \nKenjaku's careful planning leading to the sealing of Satoru Gojo.Kenjaku possesses the bodies of other sorcerers and utilizes their techniques in addition to his own natural skillset. He uses Cursed Spirit Manipulation with the same degree of skill as his current host, Suguru Geto. He took Suguru’s body specifically for this technique and has a masterful understanding of how it works and how best to use it for his ambitions. He forced , a grade 1 sorcerer who is familiar with Geto's technique, to retreat.\nKenjaku not only expertly applies the technique to battle but used its applications to set up his schemes as well. For example, he absorbed Mahito with Cursed Spirit Manipulation and then used Mahito’s  to set up the Culling Game. He also used the technique to absorb Tengen, who had evolved into a more cursed spirit than human, continuing to further his own ends.\nKenjaku making short work of Yuji.Kenjaku’s talent extends well beyond jujutsu sorcery. He is an excellent unarmed combatant, is highly intelligent, and is an unrivaled mastermind when it comes to underhanded schemes. Kenjaku was the orchestrator of both the  and the , two of the largest jujutsu terrorist events in modern history. Not only were they both effectively set up and executed, but went nearly perfectly to plan. The Shibuya Incident successfully sealed Satoru Gojo, the strongest sorcerer of the modern age. Kenjaku and Uraume effortlessly held off a group of sorcerers who attempted to reclaim Satoru at the end of the incident. Yuji Itadori was completely outclassed against Kenjaku and even Choso was unable to deal any significant damage. Not only did Kenjaku escape unscathed with Prison Realm, but successfully began preparations for the Culling Game as well.\nKenjaku effortlessly overpowering Choso with low-level ccurses.The combination of Kenjaku's ambition, manipulative tactics, and overall talent in jujutsu allowed him to establish a convoluted competition like the Culling Game. He used a complex blend of several sorcery techniques to create the Culling Game. So complex in fact, that Tengen had to hold an in-depth conversation with their allies to explain exactly how the Culling Game operates. Kenjaku invited a thousand players over the course of millennia, set up numerous colonies using Tengen’s pure barriers as a foundation, and established the rules of the game using a series of intricate binding vows. Some of the vows Kenjaku took upon himself include not being a game master and to end what was permanent. Kenjaku's plan was so well thought out that his enemies, the Jujutsu High sorcerers, had no choice but to participate.\nKenjaku surviving Yuki and Choso's best combined efforts.Kenjaku displayed the full range of his abilities when he bested Yuki Tsukumo, a special grade sorcerer, Choso, a special grade Death Painting Womb, and Tengen, all by himself. His barrier prowess enabled him to invade the Tombs of the Star without trouble, something Tengen had no doubts he’d be able to accomplish. One-on-one, Kenjaku had Choso completely overmatched and his opponent was unable to land a single hit. Initially, Kenjaku easily overpowered Choso using only low-level cursed spirits reinforced with his cursed energy. Even when Choso managed to surprise his creator, he failed to land an attack because Kenjaku possessed another cursed technique. Kenjaku wanted to win without revealing this technique but his arsenal of sorcery abilities are what ultimately pushed him to victory.\nYuki proved a far greater challenge than Choso, capable of overcoming any cursed spirit Kenjaku threw at her. He was forced to use everything in his arsenal to defeat Yuki, displaying his most advanced feats of jujutsu to date. As a master of barriers, Kenjaku possesses the divine skill to expand his domain without enclosing the outer shell. Only he and Sukuna are capable of doing so, not even Satoru Gojo can expand his domain without closing the barrier. The strength of Kenjaku’s barrier ripped Yuki’s simple domain to shreds and his domain’s can’t-miss attack dealt massive damage.\nKenjaku defeating Yuki Tsukumo, a fellow special grade sorcerer.Even with his domain dispelled and his cursed techniques burnt out, Kenjaku held his own against Yuki and Choso at the same time. When backed into a corner, he used clever, unpredictable, spur-of-the-moment actions to survive. (i.e. removing the top half of his head off to deflect Choso’s Piercing Blood). Unlikely to brute force his way past Yuki, Kenjaku won by outsmarting her. He let her believe victory was at hand so she’d be caught off guard by the clever ways he used his techniques. Kenjaku even survived Yuki’s last-ditch effort, a black hole, by yet again using a complex blend of jujutsu mechanics.\nKenjaku’s victory over Yuki and Choso made their allies, other powerful sorcerers, recognize that he could not be defeated with conventional means. While Kenjaku openly recognizes that he is no match for Satoru Gojo, he confidently takes on any other opponent in his path. With Suguru Geto's body, he wields an army of cursed spirits capable of single-handedly conquering a nation.\nKenjaku implementing taijutsu in tandem with Cursed Spirit Manipulation.: Kenjaku possesses masterful skills in close combat that can stand up to nearly any opponent. Like Suguru Geto, Kenjaku is a highly capable close-range combatant despite being a curse manipulator. He mainly uses taijutsu to supplement his sorcery, but Kenjaku is fully capable of relying on hand-to-hand combat if need be.\nKenjaku holding off Yuki and Choso at the same time.Kenjaku effortlessly caught 's katana while unarmed and snapped the blade with a simple clench of his fist. Moments later he held off Choso's assault in Shibuya with contemptible ease. Kenjaku casually parried every strike Choso threw at him while easily landing his own hits.\nIn the Tombs of the Star, Kenjaku once again made taking out Choso look easy by using close combat in combination with Cursed Spirit Manipulation. Yuki Tsukumo, who specializes in close combat, proved more of a challenge. However, Kenjaku held off both Yuki and Choso at the same time on his own. Kenjaku's cursed techniques were burnt out and he was forced to rely solely on taijutsu to survive. While he couldn't get off any attacks due to the sheer volume of offense coming at him, Kenjaku effectively defended himself until his techniques were replenished while only suffering moderate damage.\n: Kenjaku is a thousand-year-old individual who has accumulated a vast amount of knowledge. This includes general expertise, a comprehensive understanding of sorcery, and strategic intellect. He is extraordinarily clever and a masterfully calculating criminal mastermind. This is due to his wealth of knowledge on jujutsu sorcery and his talent for manipulation and tactical forecasting.\nKenjaku is an objective-focused individual with immense patience, willing to wait hundreds of years to create the proper conditions to accomplish his goals. His careful consideration and planning are what allowed Kenjaku's schemes to overcome the Six Eyes after losing to it multiple times in the past. Kenjaku analyzed Satoru Gojo to come up with a proper strategy to get the nigh-unbeatable sorcerer out of the way. He saw that Satoru was strongest fighting alone and as a countermeasure, Kenjaku orchestrated the Shibuya Incident to put him in unfavorable conditions. While Satoru was stifled by non-sorcerers and forced to combat several special grade cursed spirits at the same time, Kenjaku waited for just the right moment to seal him. Kenjaku also had the foresight to make sure nobody from Jujutsu High saw him as Suguru Geto, as this would've ruined the surprise that was key to distracting and sealing Satoru Gojo. \nWith his primary obstacle removed, Kenjaku immediately moved on to his next well-thought-out and extremely convoluted scheme. The Culling Game was created as a means for Kenjaku to achieve his primary goal of merging the Japanese population with Tengen. He launched the Culling Game directly after the Shibuya Incident, having fully prepared for it beforehand. Over the course of numerous generations, Kenjaku recruited sorcerers from different time periods to participate. He is the only sorcerer who knows how to transform someone into a cursed object after death, a major testament to his unmatched knowledge of jujutsu sorcery. Kenjaku even accounted for the return of Satoru Gojo and avoided a surely fatal encounter with him by forging an alliance with Sukuna.\nKenjaku's aforementioned mastery of sorcery is appropriately applied to battle. He is a cerebral fighter who can accurately analyze his opponent's abilities and use his own to overcome them in clever and complex ways. Yuki Tsukumo is one of the few sorcerers that Kenjaku encountered whom he didn't have any prior information. He was well aware of Choso's weaknesses and took advantage of them to easily overpower the Death Painting Womb, but this didn't apply to Yuki. Kenjaku analyzed Yuki throughout their battle and had to take numerous risks in order to overcome her. He began their battle by trying to keep her at a distance to observe her skills, a solid strategy that ended up backfiring. Even though he lost the exchange, Kenjaku recognized that his opponent still found his abilities troublesome. Immediately after seeing Yuki's hesitation to open a domain, Kenjaku expanded his own domain and ended up dealing massive damage.\nKenjaku displayed a talent for thinking on his feet when Choso joined Yuki's side and ambushed him. Although Choso's ambush surprised Kenjaku, he quickly adapted and avoided a fatal blow. Kenjaku ultimately defeated Yuki with deception, a sorcerer's greatest weapon. He had her believe that he was using cursed spirit manipulation to buy time for a gravity attack. This lured Yuki into range, where Kenjaku surprised her with a miniature maximum Uzumaki and dealt the finishing blow.\nKenjaku's innate technique allows him to swap bodies with another person, even if they are dead, by transplanting his brain into the body of his target. After the transplant, this technique leaves a stitched scar running horizontally through the forehead. Kenjaku can remove the top part of their head to reveal his original brain.\nOnce inside a body, Kenjaku gains access to the host's cursed energy, all their innate techniques, and memories. Even the Six Eyes cannot recognize him as an imposter as he retains the host's cursed energy. Kenjaku can live more than a thousand years thanks to his cursed technique while inhabiting different bodies.\nAs shown with his usage of Kaori Itadori’s technique fighting Choso and Yuki, its been hinted that even when switching to a new body, Kenjaku retains access and usage of his former host’s innate cursed techniques. Even if Kenjaku could collect different cursed techniques from his previous hosts there's a limit to how much his brain can store before overloading.\n: After Suguru Geto's defeat at the hands of , Kenjaku transplanted his brain with his innate technique into Suguru's body and has taken Geto as his host body, effectively giving Kenjaku access to all of Geto's memories, skills, and jujutsu. This is where he could now apparently access all of Geto's techniques.\nEquipment",

He recognized he couldn't directly overcome Naobito's speed so he distracted him with a technique activating hand sign, giving the curse enough opportunity to actually cast his domain.\nDagon accurately dedicated specific percentages of his domain's abilities to his targets and nearly eliminated all of his opponents.

Once Dagon's can't-miss attack was neutralized by Megumi, he quickly changed strategy and focused on eliminating the competing domain. While Dagon initially misunderstood Megumi's intention, he eventually figured out Megumi was planning to use his domain to create a hole for everyone to escape.

Hanami believes in Jogo's ideals along with Dagon, as they want to replace humanity with cursed spirits because they feel curses are the true humans.\nIn contrast to Hanami's peaceful convictions, Mahito has encouraged him to embrace his savagery as a spirit. In the heat of battle, Hanami learned to embrace his instincts and began to enjoy the thrill of the fight, allowing it to drive him forward beyond his limits.\nHanami has a close kinship with his allies, willing to go out of his way and briefly challenge  in order to rescue  from being exorcised.

      "abilities": "Hanami's overwhelming presence.: Hanami is a special grade cursed spirit with an incredibly durable body, powerful cursed techniques that can control plants, and an uncanny ability to hide his presence more effectively than others. He was able to take Satoru Gojo by surprise and momentarily take advantage of 's vulnerability using his Flower Field and a wooden monster in order to rescue Jogo. This was achievable due to a combination of Hanami's high intellect as a curse as well as his escaping abilities and hidden presence. Gojo himself commended Hanami's ability to run away, as he was able to evade the ' strong perception. Satoru even found Hanami far more threatening than the straightforward Jogo.\nHanami going toe to toe with the finest fighters Jujutsu High has to offer.Hanami was able to pass through the barriers of Jujutsu High due to his unique skillset and was the cornerstone of his groups assault on Jujutsu High during their raid of the cursed warehouse. The special grade curse was able to take on six of the school's most elite students, rendering the majority of them unable to fight after encountering him. Additionally, Hanami was able to survive Satoru Gojo's  after reaching his limit fighting against Yuji and Aoi Todo, although barely clinging to life.\nIn Hanami's final battle with Gojo, he was targeted due to his previous two encounters with the strongest sorcerer. While Hanami showed the capacity to follow Geto's plan to corner Gojo and was vital to his eventual sealing, he would not survive to see it through. He made a crucial mistake switching between different types of cursed techniques that Gojo was able to exploit. Hanami's eye branches are the only vulnerable points on his body, but they are incredibly vulnerable. When the branches were fully pulled out of his hard shell, Hanami's abilities drop dramatically making him incapable of withstanding another assault from Gojo.\nKasumi's katana broken on contact with Hanami's hard shell.: Hanami possesses an incredibly hard shell on his body, capable of shattering 's sword upon impact. He was also effortlessly able to brush off 's  attack despite it hitting the side of his head. A clean slash to Hanami's leg from Megumi's sword also dealt zero damage. Even after being hit directly in his blocking arm by Maki using the special grade : , he was sent flying away but only suffered minimal damage as a result.\nAfter being hit multiple times by Maki and Megumi on his weak points, Hanami was still able to withstands their attacks, recover quickly, and ultimately subdue them with ease. The most the majority of the students could hope to achieve was stall Hanami in time for more backup to arrive. Only Yuji and Aoi together were able to injure Hanami enough to make him use his full power.\n(It has been noted by  himself that while Jogo possesses more cursed energy and has an elemental advantage over Hanami, he could not have survived Yuji's  assault followed by a blow from Playful Cloud wielded by  like Hanami was able to.)\nHanami swiftly runs down Noritoshi and pummels him into the ground.: Hanami has a high degree of physical strength and can easily brutalize a human sorcerer in close range combat. Once Hanami finally closed the distance between he and Noritoshi, it only took a few strikes to incapacitate the sorcerer. On the defensive, Hanami was also able hold off Nue as the giant bird-like shikigami divebombed him with its wing.\n: Hanami was fast enough to swiftly escape with Jogo's head after a brief distraction. He was also able to completely blitz past Megumi and Noritoshi, taking them both off guard since Hanami was a great distance away before that moment.\n: Gojo has stated that Hanami has the peculiar presence of a regular spirit despite definitely being a curse. Additionally, he can move through plants and erase its presence completely, making Hanami difficult to pin down. Hanami is able to move underground using the plants to escape quickly and move through barriers, avoiding exorcism from the aforementioned sorcerer twice. He also took , a semi-grade 1 sorcerer, completely by surprise after killing off another curse that the student had just noticed.\n: Due to his nature as a special grade cursed spirit, Hanami can easily reinforce his body with cursed energy in order to regenerate lost limbs in an instant. Regained limbs maintain the same integrity as the rest of Hanami's incredibly durable body. He can regenerate his eye branch weak points as well but not if they are fully compromised and separated from his body completely.\n: Hanami's technique allows him to manifest the illusions of cursed plants into reality. While he appears to be manipulating it cursed energy, he's actually creating the cursed plants he controls with cursed energy. Any plant or wood attack can be erased from reality just as quickly as it's manifested.\n: Hanami can launch buds that feed on the cursed energy of whoever it attaches to. The more techniques the person uses, the deeper its roots will extend into their bodies. Hanami can also create a giant flower that spawns a barrage of cursed buds.\n: Hanami can create a circle of flowers around his opponents that distract them with a curse that takes away their desire to fight. Hanami can launch a long range projectile that can activate this ability as well. Flower Field can be weakened depending on Hanami's injuries and Aoi considered it to be one of the curse's weaker moves.",

He wore his signature green spotted cape over that along with a white scarf.",
      "personality": "Jogo arrogantly believing he could defeat Satoru Gojo.Jogo was defined by his pride as a cursed spirit. He was an intelligent being who was resolute in all his beliefs, willing to give his life so long as his goals were achieved in the long run. On a personal level, Jogo was always ill-tempered, irritable, and very arrogant. \nJogo believed that cursed spirits are the true humans and they are the ones who will inherit the earth. He saw humans as creatures made of lies pretending to hide their true nature with the positive emotions they show. Curses are made up of negative emotions that Jogo views as pure intent, and so he thinks that curses born from such truth are the purest forms of humans and the fake ones should be eliminated. In order to achieve this Jogo and his partners agreed to ally themselves with the curse user Pseudo-Geto.  \nJogo losing his temper and literally blowing his top.Geto shared his plans to deal with  using  but Jogo arrogantly attempted to challenge Satoru himself and take Prison Realm as a reward. Geto warned Jogo several times that Satoru couldn't be beaten but this only excited him. With his excitement rising, Jogo's heat increased as well, killing every bystander in the meeting place with a smile on his face. Jogo prided himself on strength and discredited all humans, which lead him to severely underestimate Satoru, who beat Jogo handily. He only took Satoru half-seriously and thought that if he failed it wouldn't be a big deal anyway. However, Jogo was forced to admit to himself that Geto was right, but Jogo's pride as a cursed spirit wouldn't allow him to ignore Satoru emphasizing the difference in strength. Satoru calling Jogo weak made the curse lose his temper completely. \n\"\"Unlike with humans, Jogo gets along with his fellow cursed spirits quite well. He viewed Dagon and Hanami as close friends and his dynamic with Mahito wasn't bad either. While Jogo liked to sit around and smoke in his downtime, Mahito would often intrude with his happy-go-lucky personality. \nWhen Jogo and Mahito discussed following Geto's plan to recruit , they agreed Sukuna was so valuable that they should revive him even if they were all eliminated in the process. This made Jogo smile because he was perfectly content with not being there as long as curses emerge as the true humans of the earth in the end.    \nIn , Jogo held a grudge against Satoru and tried to torment him at every chance he got. He was confident in Geto's plan and took pleasure with slaughtering humans as collateral to help stifle Satoru. He was consistently smiling and taunting Satoru until the world's strongest sorcerer got aggressive, exorcised Hanami and forced Jogo to run away. Frightened and frustrated, Jogo threatened  while running away because the  wasn't helping him enough. \nJogo enjoying tormenting Satoru by slaughtering humans.Later on, Jogo clashed with Choso about taking revenge on . Choso wanted to kill him but Jogo argued they needed to turn him into Sukuna. When Choso said he didn't care, this immediately irritated Jogo. Mahito tried to escalate the situation by agreeing he wanted to kill Yuji too, annoying Jogo because they had agreed in the past to revive him no matter what. Jogo stated that curses don't fear death and walk sincerely towards their goal because they have a drive that humans don't. Mahito argued it was okay for curses to be inconsistent and decided to turn it into a game since he had no intention of fighting Jogo. Jogo believed it was foolish to engage in a game but was forced to participate when Mahito and Choso ran off to find Yuji.  \nJogo avenging Dagon.When Dagon perished, Jogo found his remains and took a moment to mourn him despite being surrounded by sorcerers. Jogo was visibly saddened by the loss of his ally and told Dagon to leave the rest of him. He added that their souls will continue to circulate regardless of humanity and promised to meet Dagon again in the wastelands a hundred years in the future. Vengeful and angry, Jogo immediately took revenge for Dagon, burning , , and  alive one after the other.   \nJogo eventually found Yuji and didn't hesitate to feed him every finger in his possession. Once Sukuna gained control of the vessel, Jogo recognized his presence was even worse than Satoru's because it was overwhelmingly evil. Jogo didn't ask Sukuna for any favors and only told him to try and take over Yuji's permanently. Sukuna refused and revealed he had his own plans, confusing and surprising Jogo. As an appreciation for the fingers, Sukuna agreed to fight Jogo and work with him if he lost. Jogo willingly engaged Sukuna with the hopes of recruiting him knowing full well he could die in the process.   \nIn his final moments, Jogo apologizes to his allies and promises to reunite on the other side.Jogo was heavily outclassed by Sukuna and was once again forced to realize his own weakness, frustrating him throughout the fight. He didn't even bother using  because he knew Sukuna's would win in a domain battle due to his experience with Satoru. Sukuna noticed Jogo's diminished confidence and said he had spoken like a true loser. \nSukuna believed Jogo was foolish for wanting to take the place of humans. He told Jogo that flocking together and comparing yourself to those around you stunts true growth and that Jogo should've burned everything he desired to a cinder without a second thought. \nJogo cries as the King of Curses acknowledges his strength.Jogo accepted that Sukuna was right and that he probably lacked the hunger to reach the heights of Satoru Gojo. However, Sukuna admitted their fight was fun, stating that Jogo stood out amongst those he's fought in the last thousand years, encouraging the cursed spirit to stand proud because he was strong. This acknowledgment of his strength made Jogo so proud that he shed tears for the first time, completely unaware he was even capable of crying. \nIn his final moments, Jogo visualized Dagon and Hanami. He apologized for allowing them to all perish but they agreed to put their trust in Mahito, who Jogo has always propped up as their leader. Jogo didn't think they would be reborn the same as before, but he still anticipated the day he and his friends meet again because he always believed they were the true humans.",
      "abilities": "Jogo's mere presence causing non-sorcerers to combust.: Jogo was one of several unregistered special grades that appeared around 2018. He was born of humanity's fear and negative association with volcanoes and other fire-related natural disasters. This resulted in a highly intelligent cursed spirit with massive levels of cursed energy even for a special grade. Kenjaku generously placed Jogo in the same vein of strength as eight or nine of Sukuna's fingers. While Jogo proved no match for overwhelming powers like Satoru Gojo and Sukuna, he still far outclassed even the most talented sorcerers and other special grade curses. \nJogo using his maximum technique to attack with a flaming meteor.Non-sorcerers would combust in Jogo's very presence if he simply activated his cursed technique. Jujutsu sorcerers who entered his domain would suffer a similar fate. In Shibuya, the Zenin Team and Nanami considered Jogo to be leagues and bounds more powerful than fully realized Dagon, who they had just struggled mightily against. Jogo defeated Nanami, Maki, and Naobito within just a few moments using his superior speed and power. This charred half of Nanami's body, gave Maki permanent scars, and killed the head of the Zenin clan. \nJogo taking out several high level sorcerers in just a few seconds.Despite not being able to match up against Sukuna with fifteen fingers absorbed, Jogo's strength was still acknowledged by the King of curses. Sukuna admitted that Jogo's maximum technique might have hurt him had it landed. Throughout all the opponents Sukuna have faced over a thousand years, Jogo has stood out to him as one of the stronger ones, a massive endorsement of his overall power. Kenjaku would've liked to have absorbed Jogo with Cursed Spirit Manipulation and acquired his technique. \n: Jogo was incredibly fast, able to get past several grade 1 sorcerers without them noticing. He blitzed Nanami and Maki one after another, setting them both ablaze before they could react. Jogo even outmenuevered Naobito, one of the fastest jujutsu sorcerers, and burnt him alive right after.   \n: Jogo was always durable and not easily exorcised. He took a beating from Satoru Gojo himself and although he was ultimately dominated, Jogo survived hits from several of Satoru's cursed techniques, including Cursed Technique Reversal: Red. He was also able to sustain himself through a prolonged fight with Sukuna, able to recover from every physical strike he was hit with.",

      "appearance": "As described by jujutsu sorcerers, Mahito is a human-looking cursed spirit with a patchwork face and gray eyes. (In the anime, Mahito possesses heterochromia, as his left eye is dark blue and his right eye is gray.) He has long grayish-blue hair that reaches past his neck and is sectioned off into three large strands with ties at the ends. Along with his face, Mahito has stitches all across his body that give him the appearance that he was sewn together. \nMahito normally sports a black shawl that is separated into three pieces on the left sleeve. He also wears matching pants with and sometimes without white shoes.",
      "personality": "\"Thanks to the hate spewed between people... I was born.\"Mahito is a sadistic, immature cursed spirit who enjoys toying with human emotions. He believes he was born from human transgressions and considers himself the very manifestation of humans' hatred of each other. As such, Mahito believes that humans should be extinguished and cursed spirits should rule in their place.\nMahito has no sympathy for human lives and appears to place little value on even his own life. He is devoted to his cause, believing that reviving  is more important than his own well being. As long as cursed spirits eventually reign supreme, Mahito cares not if he's there to see it. Unlike his ally Jogo, who is very short-tempered and arrogant, Mahito can remain relatively calm and is playful in nature. Even so, they agree on the same goals when it comes to their race.\nPossibly due to the nature of his birth, Mahito is extremely adept at interacting with and manipulating human beings. He preys on their hatred, sorrow, and insecurities in order to direct them to act the way he wishes, even to the point where they act against their common sense. After indirectly causing the death of Junpei's mother, he convinces Junpei that the one who placed Sukuna's finger in his house that attracted the curse was  and drove Junpei to become a curse user as revenge. Mahito manipulated Junpei so completely that Junpei never considered the fact that Mahito was evil until he actually tried to defend him to Yuuji, even after seeing his experiments in the sewer.\nMahito feeding the darkness in Junpei's heart.Nanami describes Mahito as extremely immature and has a superficiality about him similar to . He enjoys toying with humans, even in battle when his life is on the line. Mahito befriended Junpei because he saw him as a toy that could be fun to play with. He coerced Junpei into becoming a curse user by feeding on his hatred. When his toy ran out of use, Mahito used him as leverage against Yuji and had even killed him without a second thought.\nMahito is also very philosophical when it comes to the concept of souls. He believes that the human soul came before the body and is intrigued by the very nature of the soul. His cursed technique is derived from this obsession, and he uses it to experiment on human victims in order to gain further knowledge.\nHe does keep his composure for the most part but can be visibly shaken when his own safety is threatened as when Yuji showed that his own attacks could do real harm to Mahito. Later when  used her cursed technique on him, he was shocked when he was hurt as her cursed technique can bypass physical resistance and attack the soul the same as Yuji's attacks. He then emphasizes getting rid of her showing his strong desire to neutralise anyone or anything capable of hurting him. At the end of his second battle with Yuji, being critically injured by Black Flash and exhausted, Mahito became terrified of Yuji when Yuji showed Mahito his resolve to hunt him down, seeing in Yuji the same callous disdain that Mahito himself showed others. Mahito then desperately tried to escape Yuji showing that despite all his bravado and pontificating, he was little more that a cruel child at heart that enjoyed hurting others when there was no danger to him but fearful when the consequences of his actions finally caught up with him.",
      "abilities": "Mahito single-handedly holding off both Yuji and Nanami.: Mahito is an unregistered Special Grade cursed spirit that eclipses the power of at least three of Sukuna's fingers at the time of his first encounter with , and only continues to grow stronger. He is younger than Jogo and as a result, is less experienced and not as powerful at first. Despite this, Mahito is far above what a Special Grade cursed spirit would normally be and demonstrates rapid growth over the course of only two months. He has very high intelligence and an extremely dangerous cursed technique. Mahito has incredible development potential, as on multiple instances he has developed in the middle of battle.\nIn a one on one fight, he was able to overwhelm Grade 1 sorcerer, , by rendering his cursed technique useless. Following that fight, Nanami believed that Mahito had to be exorcised immediately or else he would grow into something too fearsome for Jujutsu High to handle. \nIn Mahito's two on one battle with Nanami and Yuji, Mahito would also have likely defeated both jujutsu sorcerers if it were not for Sukuna's intervention. During this fight, Mahito was able to grow stronger while his life was in danger, allowing him to achieve the ability to conjure his own . \nLater, during the , Mahito went further beyond his boundaries, being able to create whole clones of himself that were indistinguishable from the original, while also developing his Soul manipulating abilities. Even after splitting his cursed energy in order to create a double, the divided Mahito still demonstrated relativity to Yuji in combat. During his fight with Yuji and later, Todo, he managed to land multiple black flashes on the two, allowing him to gain sufficient understanding of cursed energy and his own soul to activate , further increasing his power.\nMahito easily destroying multiple Mechamaru.: Mahito has great physical strength. He mercilessly beat  in their second fight, enough to make the latter cough up blood. Despite having divided strength after splitting his body to create a double, he delivered a blow (enhanced by ) to Yuji that was so powerful it made him bleed from the forehead. Mahito claimed that if he had put his back into it more, he could have split Yuji's skull. He could easily destroy numerous Mechamarus and was strong enough to pin down Nanami. When enhanced with , Mahito's hits can be so powerful they made  cough up blood despite the latter focusing his cursed energy. \nMahito blitzing past Nanami's guard.: Mahito also has immense speed. He was able to blitz past Nanami's guard in their fight when using Idle Transfiguration. He was able to outrun Yuji and attack Todo so fast the only thing he could do was to focus his cursed energy. \n: Mahito has superb reflexes. When fighting with Yuji and Todo, he was able to react to their attacks and counter. Mahito even kept up with Todo's  to an extent. He even single-handedly fought both Yuji and Nanami, all while dodging their attacks and countering extremely fast.\nMahito tricks Yuji and gets behind him.: Mahito possesses very high intellectual prowess, especially for a cursed spirit. He was accurately able to deduce that jujutsu sorcerers were investigating him and was able to set a trap for his pursuers. Mahito can also surmise his opponent's skill level and even their cursed technique after just a few exchanges. He was able to accurately do so against Nanami and he was able to realize that Yuji had the ability to see souls thanks to his relationship with Sukuna. He had also developed countermeasures to Todo's Boogie Woogie far quicker than Hanami did. He is also very adept at using a variety of tricks to fool his opponents. Along with Pseudo-Geto, Mahito often acts as the brains of his faction's operation. \n: Mahito is exceptionally difficult to kill. Not only does his cursed technique render physical attacks meaningless, but even Mahito's soul is extremely resistant to damage. Nanami attempted to crush Mahito's body, but he went through their entire battle without expressing that he felt any pain even when attacks did land. When Yuji was able to hit Mahito's soul and both jujutsu sorcerers overwhelmed Mahito, he was able to weather the storm and unlocked a new power instead of allowing his body to crumble under the pressure. While using  in a weakened state, Mahito suffered zero damage from Yuji's reinforced punches. This prompted Yuji to believe that only a Black Flash embued with his maximum cursed energy could take Mahito down.  \n: Mahito has a vast amount of cursed energy at his disposal, more so than even Sukuna's vessel after consuming three fingers. Nanami himself said that fighting Mahito until his cursed energy ran out was unrealistic. Mahito is able to use his cursed technique repeatedly without depleting his cursed energy. Only his Domain Expansion has used up significant enough amounts of cursed energy to exhaust Mahito's reserves.\nAs the events progressed, Mahito evolved his control over cursed energy. The first major results of that were shown in his fight with Yuji during the Shibuya Incident, when he used a variety of manipulations with his cursed energy to trick his opponent. Mahito's control ended up being well-refined enough to the point where he could use Black Flash practically at will.\n: Mahito's cursed technique grants him the ability to reshape souls. Doing so allows him to disfigure the body of his victims, heal his own wounds, transform his appendages into weapons, and a limitless variety of other possible transformations.  Mahito can even create a clone that may use Idle Transfiguration on himself, but not on others.\n: Mahito's Domain Expansion creates an environment where he is automatically connected with the souls of anyone inside and is capable of transfiguring them at will. His control over the technique is flexible enough that, much like Satoru Gojo, he is capable of activating it for 0.2 second intervals.",

Reggie confidently threw quick, powerful combos of punches and kicks enhanced by his great physical prowess with expert-level comfort. He was proficient enough to completely outpace Megumi in both primary hand-to-hand combat exchanges in their bout. \n: Reggie had the ability to summon all sorts of objects, which granted him a wide potential arsenal. He had a good handle on how to use everything he re-created. Reggie could comfortably wield bladed weapons like kitchen knives, combat knives, and machetes. He could even use conventionally harmless items like house plants to deal effective damage.\nReggie's analytical mind theorizing the true purpose of the Culling Game.: Reggie's most prominent asset is his analytical mind and cunning talent for subterfuge. He has a flair for deception and is a strategic fighter who aims to stay one step ahead of his opponents. Reggie is an analyst who is aware of his situation and looks to gain an advantage by any means possible. During the early stages of the Culling Game, Reggie theorized that he couldn't take the event at face value. He predicted Kenjaku would drop a metaphorical bomb on the game after only the strongest players remained. To prepare for this situation, Reggie focused on gathering allies and points. He used Remi to lead players to him where he could assess their abilities. Weak players were disposed of while Reggie attempted to recruit strong sorcerers like Megumi.  \n\"\" - Reggie's verbal deception.Reggie was prepared for a fight in case Megumi resisted. As soon as Reggie declared the negotiation had broken down, his associates immediately enacted a telegraphed ambush. Even while fighting Megumi one-on-one, Reggie constantly analyzed the mechanics of the . He also deceived his opponent with several verbal traps. Reggie mentioned both of them lack decisive attacks to eliminate one another but soon after he sent two large trucks barrelling straight for Megumi.\nWhen Hollow Wicker Basket proved ineffective against Megumi's domain, Reggie was eventually able to deduce on his own that this was due to the barrier being incomplete. He turned Megumi's  against him by deducing that its user has to bear the weight of anything within their shadow. By dropping re-created cars into the shadow, Reggie put immense pressure on Megumi and turned the tide of their battle. \nReggie turning the conditions of Megumi's domain against him.Even while under the weight of , Reggie used his tactical mindset to visualize scenarios where he could still win. He devised a hasty plan to enter the shadow voluntarily but he was able to assess the risks and realize that could easily backfire. After the weight forced Reggie to fall into the shadow, Reggie was able to save himself with quick thinking. He commanded one of the cars in the shadow to bring him back to the surface and then unleashed his ace, a small house.\nReggie's ace likely would have won him the battle but Megumi was able to counter with his own tactical intellect. Despite the jarring situation, Reggie was able to figure out exactly what happened and how his opponent escaped. In the last stretch of their fight, Megumi used Reggie's analysis against him. Reggie inaccurately believed that Megumi's shikigami couldn't be resummoned when they were injured. Megumi reinforced this notion by keeping Divine Dog out of most of their battle. Furthermore, Megumi used his domain and dropped Reggie into a pool to negate Contractual Re-Creation. This led Reggie to believe that Megumi's only option was to summon something other than Divine Dog, leaving him open to a lethal attack from that very shikigami.",

      "personality": "Ryu expecting Yuta to satiate his hunger.Ryu is a confident hotshot with a strong drive to enjoy fulfilling combat. He is defined by his desire to fight worthy opponents and likens the experience to eating delicacies. Ryu fought modest opponents and met a good woman in his last life, so he didn't die with sentiments that he would label as regrets. However, those fights never satisfied Ryu and it left him with a hunger that followed him into reincarnation. Ryu believes he's never been full and wants to fight someone who could push his abilities to the limit, a dessert that could fill his insatiable hunger. Ryu is a self-assured, calm, and cool individual who's indifferent to anything that doesn't pique his interest. He kills other players in the Culling Game without a second thought and is indifferent to any non-combatants that get caught in the crossfire. \nRyu's gaze communicating four-hundred years of hunger for a satisfying battle.In the Sendai Colony, only  really grabbed Ryu's attention. Ryu thought the deadlock breaking within the colony was an interesting development and marked Yuta as a worthy potential opponent. During Yuta's fight with , Ryu interjected because their \"flirting\" was making him hungry. When the battle royal appeared to overwhelm Yuta, Ryu was disappointed and compared the experience to seeing a delicious cake shop with empty displays when the store is closing. Yuta instead continued to surpass Ryu's expectations and the latter became more determined to discover if Yuta could provide him with the dessert he's longed for. In heat of their three-way fight, Ryu interrupted another exchange of words between Yuta and Uro because he felt words were pointless at that stage. \nIn order to achieve his goal, Ryu cast aside all others in order to \"set the table\" for his dessert with Yuta. He got Uro out of the way because she wasn't invited to the table where Ryu could have a proper battle with Yuta. Once the table was set, Ryu communicated four hundred years of hunger and thirst for a worthy fight to Yuta with a single, meaningful glare. Yuta finds no deeper meaning in fighting, but his heart was melted and he agreed to engage Ryu with every lost drop of power for a proper dessert. \n\"\"During their duel's climax, Ryu was enjoying every moment of pushing his powers to their limit and described the sensation as seriously sweet. As Yuta continued to surpass expectations and grant Ryu more action after using every last drop, Ryu's excitement grew until he officially deemed the encounter as the dessert he'd longed for. Even in defeat, Ryu was gracious and thanked Yuta before declaring that his stomach was finally full.\nRyu was grateful for having his hunger satisfied but not for having his life spared by Yuta. He didn't commend or praise Yuta for letting an opponent live and told him he was too soft. However, Ryu was curious and also asked about Yuta's conversations with Uro, comparing them to a lover's quarrel. He told Yuta not to act like it was a pain, but when Yuta explained, Ryu didn't quite understand what he meant by being unable to connect with Uro because he was blessed. Regardless, Ryu got along with Yuta and agreed to hand over all the points he scored in the Culling Game.",
      "abilities": "Ryu's wide and destructive attack range simultaneously vanquishing two exceptional fighters.: Ryu is a sorcerer that boasts incredible destructive power and the highest  output of any player in the Culling Game. He was able to score seventy-seven points in twelve days in one of the game's fiercest colonies and forced a deadlock with other exceptional players like , , and Uro. \nRyu's ability to fire cursed energy like a cannon makes him a massive wide-range threat. He is also the only sorcerer who can unleash the same amount of power regardless of whether or not his cursed technique is activated. His pure offensive firepower annihilated most of Kurourushi in one shot. While he's normally at a disadvantage against Uro's ability to redirect his blasts, he was able to defeat her with the same blast as Kurourushi when she was unable to activate her cursed technique following domain expansion. \nRyu's combination of cursed energy output and martial arts.While Ryu excels at long-range combat, he does not rely on it and is just as dangerous at close to mid-range. By supplementing his attacks with explosive bursts of cursed energy, Ryu clashed on equal terms with Yuta's enhanced strength and even overpowered him in more than one exchange. Yuta admitted even he would be injured by Ryu's attacks if they were not completely blocked. Ryu managed to injure Yuta by utilizing his high cursed energy output in clever ways. For example, Ryu discharged cursed energy when he collided backs with Yuta, sending the young man flying on impact. Then once Yuta was at a distance, Ryu was able to capitalize with his signature blast of cursed energy. \nRyu overpowering even Rika in close combat.Rika, who's even more resilient than Yuta, found herself overwhelmed by Ryu's power. Ryu's toughness allowed him to withstand a blow from Rika and he counterattacked before she could land a follow up attack. Toward the end of his fight with Yuta, Ryu hit a partially manifested Rika with a blow so powerful that it would've been too strong for her even at full power. \n: In addition to his long range capabilities, Ryu is an exceptional close combat fighter. Utilizing his hair as the barrel of a cannon allows Ryu to keep his hands free and he's more than capable of using them to pummel his opponent. He was evenly matched with Yuta in most of their exchanges. He blocked Yuta's initial attack upon bringing their fight into close range and continued to match blows with him throughout their battle into its climax.\nRyu blocking Rika's blast of cursed energy with just his hand.: Ryu withstood numerous direct attacks in his battle with Uro and Yuta, including being hit with his own Granite Blast. He also took several hits from Rika, a curse endowed with super strength, and not only continued fighting, but also delivered powerful counterattacks. Reinforced by his cursed energy, Ryu blocked a directed blast of cursed energy from Rika with just one hand. Even after Yuta hit him with Thin Ice Breaker and Rika busted him open with a punch to the top of his head, Ryu didn't go down until he was unsuspectingly hit by another one of his own blasts.\n: While his offense is fairly straightforward, Ryu applies clever tactics in battle and can catch on to his opponent's strategies as well. Ryu is a highly observant individual who ascertains his opponent's skills before putting himself at risk. He knew he was at a disadvantage against Uro's ability to redirect his beams and didn't make a move to break the deadlock in the colony until Yuta arrived and eliminated Dhruv. Ryu deduced on his own that he was only able to move in on Dhruv without a reaction only because he was completely preoccupied with Yuta. \nRyu applying his unique abilities in clever fashion.While Yuta was fighting Kurourushi, Ryu observed how he fought. He first took note of Yuta's cursed energy output and the cursed spirit accompany him, crediting both of them as possible factors in Dhruv's defeat. When Yuta exorcised Kurourushi, Ryu immediately recognized he was able to do so by converting reversed cursed technique into an outputted attack. Ryu felt comfortable moving in on Yuta after Uro attacked him and took over the momentum of the battle with a single calculated move. When the trio all used domain expansion at the same time, both Ryu and Uro knew to form their barriers quickly to prevent Rika from entering and giving Yuta the initiative. \nIn the climax of Ryu's clash with Yuta, he realized he misjudged how Yuta's abilities work. Ryu first thought that Rika had a cursed technique of her own and later realized that Yuta can actually copy other cursed techniques. With a solid grasp of jujutsu sorcery, Ryu knew that such an ability couldn't be conditionless and deduced that he fulfilled such a condition to copy Uro's technique when Rika consumed her arm.",

She wanted to be the one who killed Sukuna and took in his solitude for herself. Like the other incarnated sorcerers of her era, Yorozu agreed to the Culling Game to fight with the strongest opponents possible, namely Sukuna. Even one thousand years later, Yorozu's primary desire was to find Sukuna and teach him about love. She always believed that she could show him the strength and solitude that comes with love. Yorozu refused to believe anyone else could show Sukuna and was intent on performing the act herself using all her heart.\nYorozu is self-serving and cared little for  or his sister.

This led to strange behavior like Hiromi laying in a bathtub filled with water while fully clothed in his suit and tie. \nDespite the seriousness of the change his change in his mental state, Hiromi joked with Yuji as if he was just someone having a mid-life crisis. He even made a momentary quip about wanting to play the money-grubbing lawyer he never was before. \nHiguruma claiming all people are weak and ugly.Upon initially becoming a player in the Culling Game, Hiromi's interest was in the possibilities in the rules of the game. At this point, he was dissatisfied with the law and felt they were completely powerless. However, the Culling Game could accurately punish rule breakers without prolonged prosecutions. He genuinely felt like a world like that would be more proper and wanted to see how the game would play out regardless of numerous people losing their lives.\nHiromi's interest in the Culling Game initially led him to deny Yuji when the boy asked him to put his points toward helping put a stop to the game. When Yuji forced the issue, Hiromi stated that among the new things he tried, killing people who annoyed him felt better than he expected. He responded to Yuji with deadly force and tried to eliminate him. \nHiguruma returns to his roots of helping the weak by cooperating with Yuji.This was until Hiromi heard him confess to a crime he wasn't guilty of. Hiromi tried to ignore this by reminding himself that he was tired of empathizing with the weakness of ugly people day after day. Every time Hiromi tried to help someone he ended up thinking of them as ugly. He called Yuji ugly just like everyone else because regardless of what he aspires to be, only emptiness lies ahead. Hiromi compared it to shining a light into endless darkness. \nHowever, Hiromi used to value the ugliness of human beings because that very depravity is something that no other species has. Hiromi knew Yuji was innocent of what happened during the Shibuya Incident and couldn't understand why Yuji would confess. Reminded of why he got into law in the first place, Hiromi chose to stop ignoring what Yuji did and ceased hostility towards him. This helped Hiromi return to normal, his previous more stable state of mind. He agreed to talk with Yuji civically and used his points to help all the weak people still out in the world.\nHiromi carries guilt with him after what he did to the prosecutor and judge during Keita's trial. It was difficult to turn back after doing so and he's expressed that killing someone of his own volition felt awful. He chose not to accompany Yuji any further because he feels he needs to take responsibility for the crime he committed. He needed to ponder his course of action and get space from Yuji because he reminded him of how far he fell from his roots.",
      "abilities": "Hiromi overpowering Yuji after stripping him of cursed energy.: Hiromi was always someone considered a genius by those around him. He was a brilliant lawyer that regularly overcame the toughest academic and legal challenges. However, his natural talent as a sorcerer is what stands out most about Hiromi. He analyzed the  that came by default with his  and learned the fundamentals of  from that. By essentially reverse engineering barrier techniques, Hiromi attainted an instinctive grasp on how to manipulate . \nWithin twelve days of awakening his cursed techniques, Hiromi reached a level comparable to that of a  sorcerer. Before entering Tokyo Colony No. 1, Higuruma exorcised numerous . Inside the colony, he killed at least twenty players who attacked him. This made Hiromi the first modern sorcerer to score 100 points in the Culling Game.\nHiguruma's talent as a lawyer blending with his sorcery.Hiromi's talent as a lawyer perfectly translated into sorcery thanks to his compatible cursed technique. He can prosecute opponents using his superior knowledge of law proceedings while facing them one-on-one in his domain. Once he's succeeded in getting his target punished by Judgeman (i.e. having their cursed technique confiscated), Hiromi has enough fighting ability to take advantage, allowing him to crush them using his shape-shifting gavel.\nHiguruma's weapon dexterity and natural proficiency for battle.Hiromi was able to convince Judgeman that Yuji was guilty and took away his ability to use cursed energy altogether. He tried to take Yuji out immediately but quickly realized that his opponent's resistance was due to his superhuman physical prowess. Hiromi responded by going all out and his full might nearly eliminate Yuji, who only managed to save himself by demanding a retrial at the last moment.\n: Higuruma is highly proficient at wielding his gavel cursed tool in battle. His main form of direct combat is using the gavel to smash his opponents. He makes it slightly change form to emulate an arsenal, displaying his weapon dexterity and ability to wield different types of arms. Yuji found himself nearly crushed by Hiromi and noted how the sorcerer was extremely powerful.\nHiromi successfully convincing Judgeman that Yuji is guilty.: Hiromi is extraordinarily brilliant even by Law School standards. On top of the peers who already believe him to be a genius, one of his senior mentors recommended he become a judge before even graduating. Hiromi has always readily overcome challenges such as his Law School's entrance exam and the national bar exam. To him, it was just a simple matter of using the necessary effort to ascertain the required knowledge. He applies the same reasoning to being a sorcerer, making up for the lack of experience professional sorcerers would normally have. \nIn just under two weeks, Hiromi studied and deduced the details of jujutsu based on his awakened cursed technique. While barrier techniques are complicated to most sorcerers, Hiromi was able to reverse engineer how casting barriers works in order to master control over his cursed energy. \nWhen Judgeman confiscated Yuji's cursed energy, Hiromi was quick to figure out that this occurred because Yuji does not possess an innate cursed technique. He also surmised that sorcerers normally lose their instincts after having their cursed technique taken away. While not having cursed energy is even more disadvantageous, Yuji survived Hiromi's onslaught with pure innate talent. Rather than write Yuji off, Hiromi the threat he possessed and never underestimated Yuji. Instead, he immediately poured all his effort into crushing Yuji before giving him any chance. \n: Hiromi possesses a cursed technique that allows him to conjure a large  with a black body that has three stubbed points that act as two arms and a leg. Each arm holds a scale and the shikigami's white face has eyes that are sewn shut with three switches each. This gives Judgeman an appearance that resembles Lady Justice, which represents \"blind justice\". Judgeman has the ability to speak and is apparently impatient. \n: Hiromi's innate technique is linked to his Domain Expansion by default. It manifests a small courtroom domain surrounded by guillotines where he and his opponent are placed on podiums standing across from one other. This domain does not use a guaranteed hit, instead, anyone inside is simply forced to follow its rules. Violence is not permitted in the domain and anyone who tries to engage will be returned to their podium. \nInside the courtroom, Judgeman floats behind Hiromi, who acts as the prosecution. Hiromi's opponent is the defendant and Judgeman knows everything about everyone inside the domain. Hiromi does not receive any information from Judgeman, just evidence the shikigami submits for deliberation. The evidence is not conclusive and the defendant is not told what's inside. While inside the domain, the defendant is put on trial by the Judgeman and the verdict depends solely on the arguments they make with Hiromi. The defendant's goal is to dispel all doubt and earn a pronouncement of innocence from Judgeman. \nBoth the defendant and the prosecution have just one chance to make a statement before Judgeman delivers a verdict. The defendant has three options: silence, confession, and denial. After which Hiromi has a chance to offer his rebuttal based on the evidence he was given. All of these rules must be explained as per a Binding Vow on the domain. A guilty verdict can result in Judgeman confiscating their ability to control cursed energy.\nEquipment",

Towards the end of his life, after presumably spending the majority of it fighting sorcerers, Hajime was ultimately bored and unsatisfied with the battles he fought. He values life very differently from people of the modern-day and only agreed to Kenjaku's terms in order to fight Sukuna, the most powerful potential opponent.\nHajime's way of showing respect for someone, expressing that their battle was enjoyable.The incarnated sorcerer quickly became bored with the Culling Game even after slaughtering over forty players. His focus became exclusively on searching out Sukuna which eventually lead him to cross paths with  and . He found Panda to be below average but Hakari provided Hajime with a real challenge, which he found very interesting due to the unique nature of his abilities. Rather than take the easy route of outlasting Hakari's jackpot, Hajime desired to kill him while he was unkillable for the most satisfying win possible. To Hajime, anything less is how a loser thinks.\nEven when a fight isn't going his way or his life is in mortal danger, Hajime relishes the challenge. When Hakari attempted to drop Hajime into the sea, he kept a smirk on his face and admitted it was a good idea despite knowing he would be put at a heavy disadvantage. Hajime respected Hakari because he provided him with a stimulating battle, even admitting that the fight was fun, a compliment he hadn't bestowed on any opponent in the Culling Game. In the aftermath of their death match, Hajime told Hakari to kill him since he was the loser. Despite this, they were able to hold a cordial conversation and Hajime even agreed to join forces with Hakari in exchange for getting to challenge Sukuna. However, Hajime was fairly annoyed and confused when he learned Hakari was \"Sukuna's senpai\".\nSynopsisHaving killed a male sorcerer, Hajime expresses frustration over how weak the opponents in Tokyo Colony No. 2 are and wonders where  is.

The 9th Rule of the Culling Game as specified by Hajime allows all players to access information about other players by accessing .

Although Kenjaku considered him inferior to Sukuna, he respected Hajime's strength and invited him to enter a  to participate in the Culling Game. Even as an elderly man, Hajime could decimate entire battlefields and leave numerous dismembered corpses in his wake. \nReturned to a youthful body with a second chance at the prime of his life, Hajime quickly dominated the Culling Game and became the first player to add a new rule. Hajime effortlessly eliminated at least forty other players in only twelve days and gained notoriety throughout the Tokyo colonies. Hajime considered all those he eliminated to be far too weak, even more so than those from 400 years ago. \nHajime effortlessly dispatching Culling Game players.When Hajime encountered Panda, they quickly considered that the harmless animal could actually be another player. He attacked Panda and completely outclassed him in a fight. Panda considered Hajime to be overwhelmingly swift and devastatingly strong. Hajime's speed, strength, and durability quickly overpowered even Panda's . Able to overcome 's attacks, including withstanding  with ease, Hajime considered Panda to be a weakling as well. Even when faced with Panda's trump card, Hajime easily overcame his opponent's Triceratops Mode using his electrified  that struck like a bolt of lightning. \nMatched up against Hakari, Hajime was able to go toe-to-toe with the elite Jujutsu High student while he was overflowing with infinite cursed energy. While the damage wasn't long-lasting due to Hakari's fully automatic , Hajime was able to momentarily overpower him by blasting his arm off with a bolt of lightning. \nHajime quickly overpowering Panda.: Hajime is an exceptional fighter on all accounts and this is exemplified by his mastery of martial arts. Rather than depend on his cursed technique, Hajime prefers close combat and overwhelms his opponent with flurries of strikes supplemented by electrified cursed energy. Even while armed with his pole, Hajime openly engaged in unarmed striking and pummeled Panda with a barrage of punches. \nHajime using elaborate parries and counterstrikes.Up against an opponent with physical capabilities improved by infinite cursed energy, Kashimo was still able to hold his own and fight on even terms with Hakari. For example, Hajime hit Hakari with a three-hit combination that included a high kick, a right jab, and a knee to the face. Then he countered Hakari's flying knee with a spinning elbow. A testament to Hajime's skill in close combat is his ability to parry attacks into grappling situations to land elbows and knees. \nIn Hakari's base state, Hajime was easily able to outpace and overpower him, displaying his overall mastery of martial arts. His opponent couldn't defend against Hajime's strikes and Hajime could easily read Hakari's attacks and parry them. He avoided Hakari's punch slipped around behind him and elbowed his neck, knocking Hakari unconscious. After Hakari undid the damage, Hajime slipped another strike, moved his opponent's arm from a defensive position, and landed a chop followed by an elbow that knocked Hakari out again.  \nHajime trying to destroy a reverse cursed technique user's head in one shot.: Hajime's clever decision-making and use of his strengths display his wealth of experience and high battle IQ. He quickly assesses his opponent's capabilities and uses his own to create a clear path to victory. Hajime took a single hit from Panda's Unblockable Drumming Beat and could tell it dealt internal damage. He dealt with Panda's unblockable attack by using superior speed and fighting technique to effortlessly outmaneuver and overpower Gorilla Mode. Hajime severed Panda's arm and used it as a feint to get his opponent to turn around and leave himself open.  \nAgainst Hakari's unique power set, Hajime understood the potential of his opponent's power without knowing the full details of his cursed technique. After their first hand-to-hand combat exchange, Hajime realized that Hakari's massive cursed energy output could resist his electrified cursed energy. After learning how Hakari's  and unkillable mode work, Hajime knew that he could win the fight simply by outlasting Hakari's bonus round and killing him in his base state. Hajime's lust for a challenge led him to do the opposite, but he did form a definitive plan to defeat Hakari.\nHajime receiving an extra electrical charge as feedback through his opponent as the chosen route.Hajime attempted to kill Hakari in his unkillable mode using a number of clever tactics. He used his advanced knowledge of  to try and overcome Hakari's automatic reverse cursed technique. Hajime is aware reverse cursed energy flows from a sorcerer's brain and tried to destroy Hakari's head with several would-be fatal strikes, including a lightning bolt to his face. Hakari assumed Hajime's lightning needed time to recharge before he could fire again but in reality, the ladder had accumulated another electrical on his polearm in advance. Using a different method to kill Hakari, Hajime received the electrical charge as feedback through Hakari's torso, dealing a fatal blow just as the time for his bonus round ended. When Hakari's luck overcame this, Hajime tried to poison him instead of destroying his head. He used his electrified cursed energy to perform electrolysis on seawater in order to create chlorine gas. Hajime's final attempt on Hakari's life was to use his remaining cursed energy to create a steam explosion while they were fighting underwater. He grabbed onto Hakari's arm at the same time so in case he survived the explosion, he would lose his arm and wouldn't be able to open his domain again. \nEquipment",

Ogi believes his daughters were the reason he wasn't chosen to become head of the family. He doesn't value them at all and even resents both of them. In order to gain favor with the jujutsu higher-ups, he volunteered to frame his own children and execute them personally. \nAfter attacking his own daughters, Ogi was only brought to tears by the recollection that he was unable to achieve this goal.

      "personality": "Naoya's haughty attitude.From a young age, Naoya was always praised and told by others that he was a genius. He was severely spoiled as the youngest and most promising of the Naobito's children. He was conditioned to view himself as his father's successor and as a result, Naoya's arrogance grew to unbridled levels even as a small child. He looked down on all those he views as weaker than him, which is the vast majority of the people Naoya came across. \nThe only person Naoya ever appeared to have any respect for was . He went to visit him as a child to mock the pitiful man without  but was instantly able to recognize Toji was extremely strong in spite of that. This led Naoya to embrace the ideology that the sin of the insignificant is the ignorance of true strength. Naoya felt he was one of the only ones who understood Toji and strived to be as exceptional as he was. \nNaoya's pompous remarks irritating his fellow clansmen.Naoya confidently pursued strength to the point where he viewed everyone else as inferior to himself. He refused to acknowledge anyone's talent, referring to his elders,  and , as weaklings despite their experience as senior members of the clan. Naoya's reckless and conceited attitude irritates even his fellow clansmen, to the point where Ogi and Jinichi attacked him for being excessively pompous. \nNaoya enraged by the revelation that someone else could become head of the clan.Raised in an environment that breeds superiority, Naoya developed several sociopathic and narcissistic tendencies and strongly embodied all the stigma about the Zenin clan. He has no family values whatsoever other than trying to outdo everyone to become head of the clan. He didn't express any amount of concern for Naobito, his father, on his death bed and has said more than once that he hates all his older brothers as well. Naoya views women only as wives and casually told Maki and Mai's mother that a woman who can't walk three paces behind a man should be stabbed in the back.  \nUpon learning that  usurped him for the head of the clan, Naoya didn't hesitate to plot a way to kill him. Naoya was well aware that his clansmen might prefer Megumi to himself but didn't care at all for their approval. He had no issues attacking Megumi's allies in an attempt to draw him out and was willing to kill them in order to do so. \nNaoya harassing Maki to stroke his own ego.Naoya set his pride aside momentarily to work alongside , but only did so to achieve his own self-serving goals. Even after Yuta checked on him after his loss to , Naoya was irritated with the young man for looking down on him. \nDissatisfied with his plans going awry, Naoya took out his irritation with  and mocked her repeatedly upon her return to the Zenin clan's property. He called her scum, taunted her for her scars, and devalued her as a person not only for her appearance but her inability to use jujutsu as well. He called her a lapdog for following Yuta and Megumi, and threatened to abuse his own cousin in the same manner that he used to bully her in the past.\nUpon learning of the Jinichi and Ogi's refusal to leave Megumi the family fortune, it was confirmed that Naoya was not the clan's first choice. This irritated Naoya, but he was fine with the conspiracy to get rid of Megumi, Maki, and  so long as it served him in the end. \n\"\"Mai sacrificed herself in exchange for granting Maki a body with power comparable to Toji's. As Maki massacred her way through the Zenin clan, Naoya didn't show the slightest hint of distress for his family members. In fact, he was amused by Maki's power and simply teased her for being so ruthless. \nNaoya refused to acknowledge Maki as being in the same realm of strength as Toji. That is a title that Naoya desired and he fought Maki to deny her that more than he did to avenge his own clan. Up until the moment he was defeated, Naoya remained in denial and referred to Maki as nothing more than an imposter. \nEven after being brutally bested by Maki, Naoya mocked her for not finishing him off. Fate's sense of irony came for Naoya in the form of Maki's mother stabbing him in the back, just as he said women deserved. As Naoya was losing his life in such a pitiful manner, all he could do was use his last words to insult his assailant.\nNaoya retaining his ego as a vengeful curse hellbent on killing Maki.Naoya retained his ego and the entirety of his arrogant personality when he became a vengeful cursed spirit after death. Dying in such a way and losing to Maki only fueled Naoya's grudge against her. His lone desire was to kill Maki and prove he was the one to stand beside Toji in terms of strength. \nNaoya's overconfidence only grew as his power rose. After suffering a near-fatal blow as a cursed womb, Naoya pretended he felt sorry for hurting other cursed spirits only to immediately take it back and evolve into a more powerful state. Once evolved, Naoya claimed that he couldn't remember a time he was weaker than Maki despite openly acknowledging that she once defeated him. Maki wasn't the only one he held a grudge against, Naoya also admitted he hated  for what Choso did to him and took out those transgressions on Noritoshi. Wholely focused on Maki, Naoya treated Noritoshi and all others as an afterthought.\nNaoya also completely disregarded Maki's growth throughout their rematch. The more Naoya failed to kill Maki, the more resentful, desperate, and frustrated he became. His speed couldn't overwhelm Maki after she was enlightened, irritating him to the point where he lashed out in a tantrum. Once cornered by Maki, Naoya continued to refuse that she was the next Toji and went on a tirade claiming the one who stands beside Toji is himself. Naoya regained his composure after expanding to his domain, but this ended up being to his detriment. His overconfidence in his domain led him to underestimate Maki and completely overlook her lack of cursed energy and how his domain would be unable to locate her. Even when Maki struck him from behind, Naoya believed his domain could hold her, directly resulting in his demise. He attempted to call Maki an imposter to once again only to be interrupted by her finishing blow.",
      "abilities": "Naoya effortlessly dodging Yuji and Choso's attacks.: Naoya was a special grade 1 sorcerer and head of the Hei, the Zenin clan's most powerful collective of sorcerers. He was considered to be amongst the pinnacle of talent within one of  with strength comparable to his father's. Naoya considers other strong sorcerers within the clan such as Ogi and Jinichi weak compared to himself. \nNaoya employed the cursed technique he inherited from Naobito with elite proficiency. It granted him incredible speed that Naoya prided himself on. He combined his strategic intellect with his close combat prowess to quickly overwhelm his enemies without suffering any damage. Naoya had the same knack for timing as his father and prioritized gathering speed even more than the former head did. \nNaoya overwhelming Choso with ease.In his first encounter with  and Choso, Naoya was able blitz right past the defenses of the two exceptional fighters and landed a hard hit before parrying a counterattack and escaping without suffering a blow. It happened so fast that Yuji and Choso weren't even sure what happened, but they immediately associated this with a cursed technique. Naoya expected to take Yuji out in one hit and admitted 's vessel was tougher than expected. He followed up by confidently adding that he could increase his speed even further. \nFighting Choso one-on-one, Naoya was quickly able to overpower the special grade . Thanks to information on the other sorcerer clans, Naoya was familiar with  and focused on preventing Choso from controlling blood outside his body. His high-speed attacks put Choso at such a disadvantage that Naoya didn't even need to divulge how Projection Sorcerery works. Naoya believed that his speed could prevent Choso from charging up  and releasing , Blood Manipulation's most fearsome move, leaving him assured of victory.  \nNaoya's overconfidence leading him to get caught by surprise.Naoya generally doesn't fight with weapons because he prides himself on being a sorcerer that uses jujutsu over armed combat. He finds sorcerers that rely on weapons to be shameful and hides the only knife he uses to keep it a secret. Naoya only resorted to cutting Choso with the knife because he proved to be highly resilient to unarmed blows. Naoya believed there was nothing to fear after Choso's injury and this compiling overconfidence lead to his downfall. \nNaoya contending with Maki even after she escaped from cursed energy.Naoya was unaware that Choso is essentially a fully fleshed curse and has the ability to bleed far more than a normal human. This caught him off guard and Naoya accidentally turned the tables on himself. \nDespite being soaked in Choso's blood and weighed down by its weight, Naoya still believed he could win with speed alone. However, he relied too heavily on his familiarity with Blood Manipulation and walked right into Choso's  attack, a technique unique only to him. Naoya proved to be a fighter on par with Choso's level of power but suffered on account of his own boundless overconfidence.    \nNaoya building up to his top speed, reaching beyond subsonic levels.Once Maki attained a body that escaped cursed energy, Naoya was the only member of the Hei who could contend with her for more than a few moments. Naoya's continuously growing speed paired with his relentless physical attacks proved to be a problem even for Maki's immensely enhanced physical prowess. He was able to barrage her with one high-impact combo after another, destroying the terrain around them with each consecutive attack. \nNaoya gaining an advantage over Maki using strength made from weight and speed.Naoya learned from his mistake against Choso and didn't stop accelerating against Maki. He planned to punch through her body using strength forged from his weight and his subsonic speed together. When she attempted to goad him into a direct assault, Naoya didn't take the bait. Naoya's skills and intellect were undeniable but his arrogance often clouded his judgment. His plan was to trap her but she was able to obey the 24FPS, something he found inconceivable because he refused to acknowledge her strength.    \nNaoya was even more powerful as a vengeful cursed spirit that retained his innate technique. Even as a cursed womb, Naoya's speed increased exponentially. He could fly through the air at supersonic speeds, so fast that Noritoshi couldn't even follow his movements. Despite her exceptional physical prowess, Naoya even pinned down Maki with his initial high-speed attack. Naoya fought Maki and Noritoshi at the same time and survived several direct hits from both, keeping them at bay long enough to evolve into a new state. \nNaoya's power as a curse overpowering even Maki.Empowered with a cursed spirit body built for speed, Naoya nearly defeated Maki's body of steel by hitting her while moving at mach 3. Noritoshi saved Maki but he was no match for Naoya in this form and could only buy time using Blood Manipulation. Naoya likely would have bested Maki and Noritoshi one-on-one but they protected each other and newcomers helped them throughout the battle. Noaya injured Noritoshi to the point where he couldn't participate in the rest of the fight once the newcomers joined in. Naoya took on several opponents at the same time and even unlocked the ability to use domain expansion. Naoya's domain effortlessly defeated Hagane Daido and Rokujushi Miyo but it was unable to detect Maki, leading to Naoya's defeat.   \nNaoya physically preventing Choso from interfering with Yuta's pursuit.: Like his father, Naoya employed the speed granted by his innate technique in combination with his martial arts skills as his main combat style. He did so with masterful skill, striking his opponents with powerful blows before disappearing and then hitting them again before they react. Naoya demonstrated elite-level hand-to-hand combat skills by mainly throwing different types of punches such as chops, backfists, elbows, uppercuts, or combinations of the like in quick succession. His defensive discipline was sharp as well, allowing him to predict his opponent's attacks and parry them with precision. \nAmplified by the speed of his cursed technique, a single body shot from Naoya slammed Choso into a stone pillar with enough force to crack it. Naoya prided himself on defeating his opponents unarmed and relied on inforcing his physical attacks with jujutsu instead. Naoya's fighting style remained in tact even after he became a curse. He used his tendrils to create makeshift arms to strike his opponents with, or used extreme speed to ram into his targets.\n: Naoya was always been considered to have a genius-level intellect, even as a child. He shared the same talent for strategic timing that Naobito possessed, allowing Naoya to calculate his opponent's moves into each approach he takes. \nNaoya instantly recognizing that Choso is adapting to his speed.While working together with Yuta to kill Yuji, Naoya accurately foresaw Choso attempting to block their path. As soon as Yuji began to run away, Naoya prevented Choso from blocking off Yuta and engaged him one-on-one. Naoya saw Choso use Blood Manipulation before their fight and knew his best course of action was to counter Piercing Blood from the start.   \nEven while obeying Projection Sorcery's 24 FPS rule, Naoya takes into account the possibility of his opponent countering. When Choso adapted to Naoya's speed using , Naoya quickly recognized this was able to avoid Choso's counteroffensive by accurately predicting his moves. Against Maki's Shiranui-Gata, Naoya deduced it was a trap and wisely decided to avoid a direct confrontation, choosing to continue gaining speed and hold on to his advantage.   \nAs his ego was retained after becoming a curse, Naoya's intellect far surpassed that of most other cursed spirits. He used clever menuevers to avoid Maki's attacks and accurately analyzed Noritoshi's abilities while fighting them both at the same time. \n\n\nEquipment",

      "personality": "Sukuna is selfish, cold-hearted, immoral, and exceptionally sadistic. When he was reincarnated shortly after Yuji ingested his finger, he commented, implying the slaughter of women and children and likening them to maggots crawling around. Due to his immense power, he rarely cares about the consequences of his actions, even if these affect his host, Yuji Itadori. In fact, he frequently taunts and insults Yuji, calling him a brat and even laughing at or enjoying Yuji's despair on multiple occasions. \nSukuna is aware of his immense power and is quite arrogant about it, brutalizing a  while being patronizing and proclaiming his superiority over it. For this reason, he is highly dismissive of his opponents and rarely takes them seriously, even explicitly stating he would kill  to his face.

He has also displayed the ability to acknowledge and praise his opponents, as shown by how before killing  Sukuna acknowledged his strength despite having completely overpowered him and told Jogo that he should be proud. \nThrough Sukuna's conversation with Yuji during their fight after possessing Megumi's body, Sukuna espouses that he likens human beings to insects and admits he is unable to comprehend why the weak cling so desperately to life instead of quietly accepting the suffering that life forces them to endure since the weak should have no right to complain. He also claims that he doesn't understand how a creature that falls apart at a touch can say that it always wants to be happy, which expresses his antipathy and disregard of human emotions and their will to live. It also reveals that Sukuna's perception of life adheres strongly to social darwinism. It is also repeatedly stated that Sukuna has a myopic view on love and does not comprehend the value of relationships.",
      "abilities": ": Back in the Golden Age of Jujutsu, the Heian Era, Ryomen Sukuna was feared and regarded by awe by all those in his time as the most powerful sorcerer of the time, defeating and killing thousands of Jujutsu sorcerers even as they sharpened their skills against him. One of his feats included single-handedly slaughtering the both the Sun-Moon-Stars and the Five Empty Generals so utterly that they were unrecognizable as corpses, the most elite of the 's Subjugation Units, leaving the authorities of Japan so utterly terrified that they were willing to hold festivities in his honor. The impact Sukuna left on history until he died earned him the title of the \"Strongest Sorcerer In History\", as well as the \"King of Curses\", regarded as the strongest Cursed Spirit in history. His strength is still held in such a high regard that even , the strongest jujutsu sorcerer of the modern age, with arrogance levels of confidence and pride in his abilities, acknowledged his strength and that a fight between the two of them would be difficult. \nMore than living up to his titles, Sukuna possesses vast amounts of  and equally incredible control over it, with an extraordinary grasp over jujutsu, but he was also not reliant on jujutsu alone, possessing overwhelming physical prowess as well, capable of dispatching almost any opponent without unveiling his true cursed technique. \nEven at his weakest state upon his incarnation in Yuji's body for most of the time he spent there, due to lacking most of his fingers, Sukuna remained extremely strong, capable of effortlessly dispatching powerful cursed spirits, including the likes of a , which he easily retrieved from the cursed spirit after completely overpowering it. While purposefully weakening himself by removing Yuji's heart to ensure Yuji could not switch back with him, Sukuna utterly defeated , the inheritor of the 's prized  and a prodigious genius who started school as a Grade 2 sorcerer with one of the highest potentials in , to where Megumi admitted how utterly outmatched he was and was more than willing to unveil  to defeat him. Sukuna would have killed Megumi had he not been interested in Megumi's unique talents, although before he could fight Megumi's trump card, Yuji managed to regain control of his body.\nSought out by Mahito's group under the belief that his revival could ensure their success, with just three fingers, Sukuna demonstrated an overwhelming superiority in power compared to  by being able to resist his  completely and effortlessly inflict such a severe injury on Mahito when finally angered too much along with dispelling his  with a single attack. This terrified and intrigued Mahito to where he came to firmly believe that with Sukuna being on such a whole other level, his resurrection would surely bring about the Age of Curses.\nOnce Yuji's body had consumed fifteen fingers, Sukuna's overwhelming cursed energy was felt throughout  once he was awakened, compared to Satoru's own while being overwhelmingly more sinister. With 75% of his strength restored, Sukuna proved capable of overwhelming , the most powerful cursed spirit in Mahito's group, in a mostly one-sided battle as he easily overpowered the best efforts of his foe, leaving him utterly unable to even land the single hit that would get Sukuna to join him, before killing him with his own speciality of fire. His last act during the  was to defeat Mahoraga single-handedly, a feat no user of the Ten Shadows Technique and even a member of the Gojo Family with the  had done.\n: There is a slim chance that Sukuna will incarnate into whoever eats his fingers, gaining a physical, human body in the process. Upon Yuji consuming the first of his twenty fingers, Sukuna immediately came to possess his body, which he used to inhabit. Unlike other incarnated sorcerers, according to the Angel inhabiting , Sukuna, after experiencing death, had developed the knowledge to split his soul as , which he demonstrated by imbuing all his cursed energy into Yuji's pinky finger and then force feeding Megumi with it to possess his body.\nSukuna's prowess against two expert hand-to-hand combat users.: While immensely powerful as a jujutsu sorcerer, Sukuna is also shown to be an extremely skilled and powerful hand-to-hand combatant, using martial arts as his first method of combat before unleashing his jujutsu abilities. Sukuna can unite his cursed technique and his hand-to-hand prowess, making him an extremely difficult opponent to overwhelm in battle.\nDuring his fight with Megumi, he was able to effortlessly overwhelm Megumi in unarmed combat, countering his attacks in close-range with ease before delivering a strong punch that send him flying. When Yuji attempted to attack him in his Innate Domain, Sukuna effortlessly countered all of Yuji's attacks before seeing through his attempt to trip him and defeating him with a single kick. \nWith fifteen fingers, Sukuna easily overpowered Jogo with hand-to-hand combat alone before finally killing him with a single use of a cursed technique. He was later capable of fighting on par with both Yuji and Maki Zenin, both being exceptional unarmed fighters with extraordinary physical ability, deflecting most of their blows and landing a few hits on his own, using hand-to-hand combat.\nSukuna's overwhelming strength.: In his first appearance Sukuna has shown to possess immense physical strength despite being in an incomplete state. He could easily defeat a very large cursed spirit with just a simple swipe, and during his fight against Gojo he was able to punch the roof of the school so hard it causes the building to rupture and crack. He easily overpowered the likes of a finger bearer, a special-grade curse. When gambling Yuji's life against Megumi, Sukuna managed to fling the sorcerer through several building floors without effort and he easily overpowered and destroyed Megumi's . He even punched Megumi so hard, the raindrops in that area dispersed. With fifteen of his fingers, Sukuna punched Jogo through buildings and even destroyed the latter's jaw. His blows had considerable effect on Mahoraga. Upon taking over Megumi's body, he was able to easily pierce through Yuji's gut and send him flying across the city with a single punch, stunning him temporarily.\nSukuna's overwhelming speed.: Sukuna has repeatedly displayed overwhelming levels of raw physical speed, capable of effortlessly surprising most opponents with the sheer quickness of his movements. With three fingers, Sukuna easily slammed a finger bearer to the ground and even cut off his arm without him noticing. He was also able to effortlessly blitz Megumi several times, delivering powerful blows with Megumi barely able to react at all. With fifteen fingers, he easily overwhelmed Jogo and was able to keep up with Mahoraga in their fight. Sukuna was even able to appear in the middle of  and , both capable sorcerers, with the former being a Grade 1 sorcerer.\n: Sukuna can easily counter any opponent and is fast enough for his opponent to not even realize that their limb has been cut off. He consistently dodged Mahoraga's blows and countered during their fight. He was quickly able to put Mahoraga down for good before he had finished regenerating. He was able to dodge Jogo's . \n: Even in Yuji's body, Sukuna can use cursed energy to bolster his host's resilience. Sukuna was punched through five buildings and shown to be completely fine. Sukuna was able to survive a 200%  during his fight with .\n Sukuna is an extremely intelligent individual. He has fully grasped the nature of cursed techniques, and curses and  as a whole. Due to that, he is able to quickly deduce the inner workings of cursed techniques after only seeing them once or twice and creating suitable foils to such techniques. He did this against Mahoraga in their fight, and was able to defeat the shikigami after gaining an understanding of its technique. \nSukuna was also able to realize the potential of Megumi's cursed technique just by seeing it once during their short battle and he was able to create a binding vow with Yuji in order to take Megumi's body patiently waiting for the right moment before executing his plan. During his fight with  by using Megumi's memories he was able to make Hana think that Megumi is in control of his body and thus when she hugged him he was able to critically injure her. \n: Sukuna can create new eyes and mouths on his host, allowing him to see and speak without controlling the body of the host. For example, he made a single eye and fanged mouth on Yuji's left cheek to belittle and taunt him.\nSukuna has an unnamed Binding Vow with Yuji. The King of Curses agreed to revive the boy after his apparent death in during the events of the  under two conditions: ① Yuji would allow Sukuna to take over his body for one full minute when the cursed spirit would chant \"Enchain\" and ② he would forget about the agreement. Yuji initially opposed the Binding Vow, making Sukuna promise that he wouldn't kill or hurt anyone during that minute. The boy still disagreed with the terms and instead had a battle against the King of Curses, where he'd allow the agreement to occur if he lost. Sukuna effortlessly defeated Yuji, forcing him into the Binding Vow.\n: Sukuna is highly proficient with reverse cursed technique. While incarnated in Yuji's body, he used his reverse cursed technique to instantly heal any injuries, including even regenerating lost limbs within moments. Regained limbs maintain the same integrity as the rest of Sukuna's body. He can go further and even heal others, something few can do. Sukuna can also use Reversed Cursed Technique to heal his burned-out Cursed Technique after seeing Gojo do it just once (Or maybe he knew it beforehand). This displays Sukuna's extremely high level usage of the Reverse Cursed Technique.\n: Sukuna's Domain Expansion creates a Buddhist shrine decorated with skulls. Malevolent Shrine has a unique trait; it doesn't create a separate space using a barrier. A binding vow is formed by allowing an escape route, which vastly increases the guaranteed hit's effective area with a maximum radius of nearly 200 meters.\nEquipment",

Even before getting to know him, Noritoshi believed Megumi more reliable than the often drunk . However, Megumi outright rejects Noritoshi and the Big Three clan's way of thinking and directly opposes it. Noritoshi was ordered to execute Yuji and claimed he was going to do so of his own free will in a desperate attempt to appease his family.

Noritoshi not only possesses natural innate talent for jujutsu but the intellect and physical skill to blend it and incorporate it into a variety of fighting styles.\nNoritoshi is a skilled archer who reinforces his arrows with cursed energy and guides them using blood.

Noritoshi survived Naoya's initial attack from his evolved state by blocking his head with blood at the last moment to protect himself, even impressing Naoya. Noritoshi and Maki strategized a countermeasure for Naoya's speed that likely would've been effective on a normal opponent, but it they underestimated the level of speed he could reach. Noritoshi held his own against Naoaya, a far superior opponent, by using his wits to survive. He recognized that Blood Manipulation was effective against cursed spirits and even spit it into Naoya's air inlet. He circulated blood he was using externally back into his body to avoid dying from blood loss despite the cost to his stamina.

This is a large part of Ino's honor code, so much so that he refuses to advance to grade 1 without Nanami's approval.  \nIno is very young for a sorcerer and gives off a little brother type of vibe, so everyone tends to help him out. When he's around people younger than himself, he has a tendency to show off his jujutsu knowledge and maturity. An example of this is shown when he went out of his way to explain curtains to Megumi, an already very educated student with good grades.

She asked him this when he was just a little kid in grade school. She was impressed by how a strong boy was bored after beating someone older than him. She took Todo under her wing and supplied him with a whole new avenue for excitement. Yuki's own personal type is a hard-working, tough-guy who isn't afraid to get his hands dirty.\nYuki discussing the nature of curses with her fellow special grade sorcerer.In 2007, Yuki sought out  to speak with someone of her rank, to who she could relate. She met Geto, and found out from him that she had built a reputation as a lazy sorcerer who bums around overseas. Yuki comically sulked when she heard but quickly revealed she couldn't care less about what Jujutsu Headquarters thought of her. Yuki wants to exterminate curses completely and she feels like Jujutsu Headquarters is only treating the symptoms. \nYuki's ideology led to a deep conversation with  about how to exterminate curses. She inadvertently led to Geto consider killing every non-sorcerer to rid the world of cursed spirits. Yuki admitted this was a viable option but also clarified she would never do that. She saw Geto clearly struggling with his morality as a sorcerer and advised him to decide how he feels about the other side in order to move on. Yuki even tried to ease his mind regarding Riko Amanai's death.\nYuki challenging Kenjaku on the future of humans and cursed energy.Yuki continued her conversation with  eleven years later in  where she elaborated on her ideals surrounding the jujutsu world. She believes that the next stage of humanity involves breaking away from cursed energy completely. Yuki rejected Kenjaku's method of turning humans into resources that would create widespread suffering, declaring that to be far from the world she pursues. \nYuki dislikes Kenjaku because he's coy and condescending. Their conversation quickly annoyed Yuki and she was ready to beat him up for his attitude. Despite her personal feelings, Yuki prioritized protecting the younger sorcerers and eventually returned them all to Jujutsu High herself. Yuki empathized with Yuji's situation following the Shibuya Incident and apologized for waiting until it was too late to act.

She and Choso weren't overly familiar with each other at first but Yuki listened to Choso express himself in an emotional conversation where she offered support. Yuki was also concerned for Choso's well-being when he offered to be the vanguard against Kenjaku. When Choso made Kenjaku reveal his abilities, Yuki revered Choso and even called him \"big brother\", a role that defines Choso as a person. Yuki likes the rough men like Choso and dislikes Kenjaku, who she feels the need to \"beat into shape\" until he's humbled and becomes her type. When Choso attempted to sacrifice himself for Yuki, she encouraged him to live on and had Tengen remove him from the fight.\nYuki is a confident fighter who remains calm and retains her playful demeanor in life-or-death battles.

This feat even impressed Pseudo-Geto, who admitted Mei Mei was exceptional for a jujutsu sorcerer of the modern era.\nMei Mei swinging her axe with grace, speed, and skill.: In a fight, Mei Mei defaults to using her battle-axe to engage her opponent at close range. She looks to cleave her opponents in two with fierce swings, doing so with incredible speed and precision considering the size of the axe. A single swing from her axe was able to kill a curse user as well as sever the arms of a special grade cursed spirit. In her battle with the Smallpox Deity, Mei Mei was able to break out of a coffin buried underground by a giant gravestone, shattering them both in a single attack.

Even in these forged memories, Aoi wears his blue sash with his pants. \nDuring the , Todo had to sever his left hand to avoid being fully transfigured by .",
      "personality": "Aoi Todo is a very unique person with an extremely eccentric attitude. He can come off as nothing more than a battle-crazed meathead to all his peers because not only does he enjoy posing and showing off his muscles but revels in the thrill of battle as well. Much of his personality also revolves around his very vocal love for his favorite tall pop-idol Takada-chan. He'll often bring her up in conversation and refuses to be late to any of her shows or meet and greets no matter what. Todo even visualizes talking to Takada sometimes when he has an inner dialogue with himself.\nAs a child, Todo was exceptionally strong but he felt his life was mundane due to his overwhelming strength. That all changed when he met  and he fondly remembers the feeling of his boredom turning upside-down. Yuki introduced herself to him by asking \"what kind of girls do you like?\", a catchphrase that Todo would adopt for himself. \nTodo bored to tears by Megumi's answer.Todo hates being bored more than anything else. He asks people what kind of girls do they like so he can get a read on them and his reaction to their replies can vary greatly. When  gave a response to this question that Todo deemed as boring, he beat the first-year to a pulp. Todo was especially irritated in this case because , a worthy opponent, wouldn't be attending Todo's last Goodwill Event, so he felt it would be uneventful. He also doesn't like any of his peers at Kyoto Jujutsu High because he's disappointed in their terrible taste in women. During the planning stage for Goodwill Event, Todo took absolutely zero interest in \"exorcising Sukuna's vessel\" and told his team and Principal Gakuganji that their schemes were stupid and he'd kill them if they tried to order him around again. \nYuji revealed that he has the same taste in women that Todo does, causing Todo's response to be drastically different from his reaction to megumi. A memory of an event that never even occurred populated Todo's head which he honestly believed to be the truth. The memory was of Yuji comforting Todo after he was rejected by Takada. From that moment on in Todo's mind, he's always been best friends with Yuji and believes no one could beat them in their hometown. Even after coming back to reality, Todo shed tears and told Yuji they're best friends, confusing the first-year. \nTodo's excitement at the prospect of a fight.While mentoring Yuji during the Goodwill Event, Todo showed a much more intelligent and even philosophical side of himself. Todo found much enjoyment in fighting with Yuji and took pride in helping foster his potential. He showed Yuji how to properly channel his cursed energy by effectively explaining how it's supposed to flow. Todo understands most people think of their body in disproportionate parts, but that every individual actually exists in the world with their entire mind, body, and soul, something most people take for granted. This philosophy is what trigged Yuji to step up his level of jujutsu considerably, eventually even learning to unleash Black Flash.\nTodo taking a liking to Yuji and willingly showing him the way to becoming a strong sorcerer.Todo is supremely confident in himself and revels in heated combat even when the situation is extremely dangerous. He made light of his own achievements during the , revealing to Megumi he only needed his cursed technique to defeat a special grade. Despite undoubtedly possessing more cursed energy than Todo, Hanami was wary of him before they ever exchanged blows just based on his intense presence and supreme confidence. Todo's peers recognize that he's the most powerful out of all of them but they don't get along at all and everyone finds him irritating. In the baseball game, it was made abundantly clear that Todo is seriously hated by all the other students. Maki hit in him the face with the baseball and everyone other than Yuji praised her for the \"nice pitch\".\nTodo confidently states that he and Yuji will never falter.In a situation as dire as the Shibuya Incident, Todo was able to maintain a completely serious composure and intelligently assess what his best course of action was. Once he noticed Prison Realm was already moved, Todo immediately moved on and prioritized rescuing his allies over rescuing Satoru Gojo. He was confident that his \"brother\" Yuji would be in the center of the chaos and went to go find him. \nTodo encourages Yuji to remember what he's been entrusted with by his fallen allies.By the time Todo found him, Yuji's body and mind were both battered and beaten by Mahito. Upon rescuing Yuji, Todo confidently stated that they were the exception to the rule that the prosperous must decline. Despite Yuji's condition, Todo encouraged him to get back up because their fight had just begun.\nYuji explained to Todo that he couldn't fight anymore because he couldn't forgive himself for allowing his allies to die. Todo told him not to constrain himself to conventional thinking because all of their allies together are jujutsu sorcerers. He believes as long as one of them lives to fight, those who have fallen will never have been truly defeated. To Todo, it's not about punishments because jujutsu sorcerers can't afford to limit themselves to such misfortune. He knows that looking back on the memories of friends who've died can be disheartening, but even so he encouraged Yuji to try and remember what his friends entrusted him. Todo didn't require Yuji to figure it out right away but told him to never stop pushing forward until he finds that answer. Todo believes that this is the only punishment sorcerers must endure.",
      "abilities": ": Aoi is an exceptionally powerful sorcerer, undoubtedly one of Jujutsu High's strongest students. He obtained the rank of a grade 1 jujutsu sorcerer as a student despite coming from a non-sorcerer family. \nAoi's intense presence.Aoi single-handily defeated five grade 1 cursed spirits and 1 special grade during Geto's Night Line attack in Kyoto. He only used his cursed technique to defeat the special grade. This feat became well known around the jujutsu community and caused the rumor that Aoi defeated all six curses without his cursed technique.\nAoi possesses physical strength that surpasses Maki and Panda's by rivaling Yuji's prowess. Using brute force and fierce martial arts, Aoi was able to easily overwhelm Megumi as well as pummel Yuji in the early stages of their bout. Even after beginning to guide Yuji on how to become stronger, Aoi maintained the upper hand while fighting due to his experience and cleverness. \nAoi using his cursed technique while working together with Yuji to fend off Hanami.Aoi and Yuji turned out to be a good match and Aoi showcased his intelligence and knowledge surrounding jujutsu sorcery and battles. Aoi's understanding of cursed energy allowed him to teach Yuji how to properly use it alongside his superhuman speed and strength. While fighting alongside Yuji, Aoi was very nearly able to defeat Hanami, one of the most powerful special grade cursed spirits to have appeared. \nDuring the heat of  against Hanami, Aoi was able to analyze all his moves and instantly create ways to counter them using his own cursed technique. Hanami initially analyzed Aoi to be weaker than himself, but the careful planning and precise teamwork with Yuji allowed Aoi to dominate the fight.\nTodo effortlessly overpowering Megumi.: Aoi prefers close quarters combat to anything else, normally relying on brute force to overpower his opponents rather than jujutsu. He completely outclassed Megumi when trading blows, easily able to outmaneuver and brutalize the first year at every turn. Even against Yuji, who's extremely talented in hand to hand fight, Aoi was able to effortlessly overpower at the start of their fight. Even as the fight went on and Yuji began to adapt to Aoi's moves, he was still able to surprise Yuji and stay one step ahead thanks to his combat experience.\nHe generally employs a mix of direct and crushing blows such as punches, forearm smashes, stomps and other brutal strikes. This type of fighting was effective against Hanami, mainly while being used alongside his cursed technique.\n: Against most opponents, Aoi is more than capable of relying on raw physicality to win fights. A single strike against Megumi was able to send him reeling back several meters. His fighting style includes a barrage of powerful blows, stomps, and suplexes in quick succession.\nTodo producing enough raw strength to damage Hanami's hard shell.A cursed energy infused strike from Aoi is capable of obliterating a lower grade curse completely while still damaging Yuji, his intended target before the curse suddenly inhibited his punch. Alongside Yuji's enhanced punches, Aoi was able to hit Hanami's guard hard enough for the special grade to acknowledge the weight of the hit. \nCombined with his cursed technique, Aoi's strength becomes even more difficult to deal with. It allows him to exploit openings in his opponent's defense which allows him to land lethal strikes using his physical strength. \nUsing Boogie Woogie to switch out his partner for a special grade cursed tool, Aoi delivered a strike so powerful it shattered Hanami's weak point, the branches growing out of his face, in a single blow. A hit so strong, Aoi believed it should have ended the fight altogether. The cursed tool,  relies on the strength of its user, further cementing Aoi's near-superhuman levels of physical power.\nTodo's speed takes Megumi off guard.: To match his incredible strength Aoi possesses extreme speed. He incorporates his frightening speed in his fighting style by continuously striking with quick succession before his opponents can react. He blitzed clean through Megumi's every defense in their fight and landed blow after blow to overpower him. \nAt the very beginning of the Goodwill Event, it took Aoi just a few seconds to reach the opposing team. He was even able to surprise Yuji with his speed and momentarily overpower him with sheer physical prowess. Aoi's speed also allows him to move unpredictably when utilizing his cursed technique, as shown while fighting Hanami. \n: Aoi's oafish demeanor fools most people, but he's actually incredibly intelligent; claiming to have an IQ of 530,000. Using his own experience and vast understanding of jujutsu, he was able to transform Yuji from a sub-par jujutsu sorcerer to a fighter capable of taking on special grade cursed spirits. Aoi even has a deeper philosophical side that was able to help Yuji grasp the understanding of jujutsu. Additionally, his thinking speed is unmatched, able to review Hanami's entire move set within just 0.01 second and accurately determine the correct way to defend against his attacks.\n: Aoi has a high degree of cursed energy and a good understanding of how to utilize it. He is able to reinforce his punches enough to obliterate curses in a single punch and can infuse his energy into cursed tools. For defense, Aoi can also apply a coating of cursed energy to his body to protect himself from attacks. Aoi possess an Innate Technique that he can use repeatedly without exhausting his energy reserves that he can utilize alongside reinforced physical applications.\nDespite having never using Black Flash himself prior to the Shibuya Incident, Aoi understands the essence of cursed energy and possesses masterful control over it. He understands the nature of how to make cursed energy flow throughout his entire body, allowing him to freely manipulate it as a part of his close combat arsenal.\n: Aoi's Innate Technique allows him to switch the positions of anything with cursed energy within his range with a clap of his hands. He can change himself out with the location of another person, or switch two different parties other than himself as well. Though a clap is required to trigger the ability, he does not have to clap  of his hands specifically, as Todo is shown triggering Boogie Woogie by clapping Mahito's hand with his own.\nEquipment",

As Gojo is leaving, he tells Yoshinobu that Yaga will arrive at the meeting in two hours.

When Masamichi refuses to tell Gakuganji how to create self-sustaining cursed corpses, the two principals engage a brief battle with Gakuganji victorious. On the verge of death, Masamichi tells Gakuganji that someone can replicate a soul's information from physical information and that information has to be placed into a cursed corpse's core. Three highly compatible cores that are constantly observing each other must then be placed into a  and only then will the souls stabilize and give rise to self-awareness, three months are then required for the cursed corpse to reach self sustaining cursed energy. Gakuganji then asks Masamichi why he didn't reveal this information before he was fatally wounded and Masamichi replies that this was a curse from him to Gakuganji, which leaves him in shock. Panda then arrives and Gakuganji prepares for a fight but Panda ignores him and rushes to Masamichi's side, cradling his body.\nGakuganji asks  why isn't fighting him and adds on wondering if he hated him. Panda tells him that he isn't like humans and human behaviors don't bind pandas.

Kokichi explains that there's a 99 % chance that Aoi would survive and that Arata's cursed technique is useful. Kasumi suddenly asks if she was so weak that he needed to act in secrecy and ensure they wouldn't be available on 31st; Kokichi refutes, saying he was truly weak for making these mistakes. While he's in the middle of talking, tears suddenly sprout from Kasumi's eyes as she hugs the device. When Kokichi tells her that it's time to say goodbye, Kasumi tearfully begs for him not to leave.

He was smug and extremely condescending towards normal humans, using fake personas to lure in vulnerable people who were cursed. Suguru found non-sorcerers disgusting enough to spray himself in order to disinfect the \"monkey stench\". He believed monkeys only have two roles in association with him, money-collecting monkeys and curse-collecting monkeys. If they weren't fulfilling their roles, Suguru would gladly allow curses to kill them without any remorse.\nSuguru's condescending attitude toward non-sorcerers.In contrast, Suguru cared deeply for his fellow curse users, referring to his commanders as family. Each of them still looks up to Suguru for putting sorcerers as a race first and hoped that he would have become king of the jujutsu world. Suguru was even polite to jujutsu sorcerers, although this was usually expressed under one of his fake personas. He pretended to befriend  with the full intention of killing him in the future and insulted one of his friends shortly after his expressing a friendly attitude. \nSuguru crying tears of joy over young sorcerers protecting each other.Suguru explained to Yuta that sorcerers live in a paradox where the strong rule over the weak. Jujutsu sorcerers live to serve non-sorcerers with no appreciation. Humanity has hindered their own evolution and in order to ensure their survival as a species and eradicate curses completely, humanity must realize a world of only sorcerers by killing off all non-sorcerers.\nAfter defeating Yuta's classmates, Suguru cried and expressed the joy he felt seeing young sorcerers work together to protect one another. With a crazed smile, Suguru cried out and stated it was the type of world he longed for. Suguru claimed he didn't want to kill Yuta, but had no choice for the future of his vision.\nWhile fighting Yuta, Suguru explained how foolish he thought it was for humans to create the concept of gods when sorcerers already exist. He thought the monkeys didn't want to admit superior physical beings exist and was disgusted by their pompous existence. Afterward, Satoru confronted his ex-best friend and admitted he trusted Suguru enough not to kill the potential of young sorcerers. \nSuguru and Satoru's last moments.In the end, Suguru used his final moments to tell Satoru that he simply couldn't be happy in this world no matter what while thinking of their time at Jujutsu High. Suguru even said Satoru should have cursed him at the end, but a bond still existed between them after everything that happened.\nAs a student of jujutsu alongside his best friend Satoru, Suguru initially believed that jujutsu sorcerers existed to protect non-sorcerers. Satoru argued Suguru shouldn't be proud of himself for being righteous and applying reasoning to jujutsu was stupid. Their clash in ideology caused them to argue and clash heads as young men. \nAs students, Suguru clashed with Satoru over the idea of jujutsu sorcerers being righteous.Suguru was a much more kind and proper young man back then, especially compared to Satoru. He understood the importance of manners and carrying himself with dignity at a jujutsu sorcerer. Satoru had far too rude of an attitude in his opinion. Despite disagreeing from time to time, Suguru and Satoru were still best friends. They encouraged each other to be the strongest and were confident they could accomplish anything as long as they had each other.\nHowever, following 's death, things began to change. The followers of the Star Religious Group applauded her death, a deplorable action that stayed with Suguru. He decided not to kill them because there needs to be a reason for jujutsu sorcerers to kill. \nA young Suguru beginning to lose his way.Suguru attempted to maintain his ideology but his path became more and more unclear as time went on. Satoru became the strongest alone and Suguru started going off on more dangerous missions alone. He felt caught in an endless cycle of exorcism and consumption. Eventually, he began questioning for whom he was doing these grotesque things for and remembered the non-sorcerers from the Star Religious Group. He saw a hideous evil that day and still chose to protect them, an action he grows to regret, calling them \"monkeys\" for the first time as he looks back on the memory. \n educated Suguru during a conversation with the information that non-sorcerers are the main reason curses are born. Cursed energy flows far more freely out of them compared to normal sorcerers. Yuki either wanted to eradicate cursed energy from all of humanity or teach everyone how to control it. This made Suguru come up with a third solution: killing all non-sorcerers. \nThe worst curse user is born.When Yuki asked Suguru if he hated non-sorcerers, he wasn't able to answer. He replied that he used to think protecting non-sorcerers was right but began doubting if they're worth fighting for. Unable to tell the difference between the preciousness and ugliness of the weak, Suguru compared being a jujutsu sorcerer to running a marathon where the finish line is much too unclear. She advised him to choose between the side of him that's devoted to being a jujutsu sorcerer and the other side that looks down on non-sorcerers.\n\"\"After losing young , Suguru's enthusiastic junior, the unsure young sorcerer revised the idea that being a jujutsu sorcerer is like running a marathon where the end of the road is just a mountain made of his fellow sorcerers' corpses. On a mission following that incident, Suguru finds two young girls being mistreated by non-sorcerers for having curse-related abilities. \nSuguru finally made his decision in that moment. He rescued the two girls,  and , and killed all one hundred and twelve residents of the village, officially becoming a curse user and leaving his Jujutsu High pin behind. Suguru chose the true side of himself, deciding that he doesn't like monkeys and will fight for a world of only sorcerers.",
      "abilities": "Suguru summoning two high level cursed spirits with his technique.: Suguru Geto was one of just four special grade sorcerers and was deemed the worst of all curse users due to the level of danger he presented to humanity. \nAs a student, Suguru and Satoru were both considered \"the strongest\". Suguru was capable of making short work of experienced curse users on multiple occasions with little effort. His collection of cursed spirits was wide with a high variety of different abilities and roles in battle. Suguru was not overly dependent on his curses and was a highly capable close-quarters fighter as well. \nSuguru fighting against Yuta and Rika at the same time using a cursed tool.During his time as a curse user, Suguru used his religious group as a lure to collect thousands of cursed spirits. Over the course of a decade, Suguru became a bigger threat to humanity than any curse at the time. With thousands of curses and several curse users by his side, Suguru had enough power behind him to declare war on Jujutsu High, the cornerstone of the jujutsu community. \nSuguru understood despite all his resources he had a low chance of defeating all the Jujutsu High sorcerers. His tactical intellect allowed him to deceive them and isolate Yuta Okkotsu at the school itself. The true goal of the  was to kill Yuta and steal special grade vengeful spirit  from him. If his curses were not split between Kyoto and Shinjuku, Suguru would have been successful.\nSuguru as a student effortlessly beating a much more experienced curse user.: Most of Suguru's opponents assume he would fight like a shikigami user and allow his cursed spirits to attack for him. Suguru uses this misconception about his technique to his advantage, letting him surprise opponents with expert martial arts skills in hand-to-hand combat. \nSuguru overpowering Panda.Suguru allowed an armed curse user to get close so he could pummel them with a mix of punches, palm strikes, and hard chops capable of knocking out teeth and leaving his opponents in a bloody heap. \n, a  who excels in close quarters fighting was even outstruck by Suguru in a brief exchange of purely physical blows. While armed with , Suguru engaged Yuta and a fully manifested Rika at the same time in close combat. He was able to parry Yuta's sword strikes and Rika's physical blows at the same time, keeping both at bay with masterful skill.\n: Suguru Geto was always a brilliant student at Jujutsu High. While Satoru would forget key points about Master Tengen and other detailed aspects of their missions, Suguru would be the one to remember and explain things to him. His intellect translated well to battle, always able to think a step ahead of his opponent. An older and more experienced curse user attempted to outmaneuver the curse manipulator into getting closer, only to fall into Suguru's trap. \nSuguru attempting to use his technique to cut off Toji's weapons cache.In his  with , Suguru managed to surprise the Sorcerer Killer for just a moment. He moved behind Toji knowing his confidence would keep his guard down and nearly absorbed the inventory curse as a means to cut off Toji's weapons supply. However, this ultimately backfired due to circumstances Suguru could not have foreseen, leaving him open to getting exploited at close range.\nWhile the jujutsu sorcerers are preoccupied with the Night Parade, Suguru infiltrates Jujutsu High.Soon after becoming a curse user, Suguru was able to take over the remnants of the Time Vessel Association and other like-minded religious groups. Doing so created a legitimate base of operations for cursed humans to come to seek exorcisms, allowing Suguru to absorb their curses or exploit them for money. Suguru was able to collect thousands of curses over that time using this method. \nThanks to resources accumulated over the course of a series of strategic moves, Suguru took on the entire Jujutsu High sorcerer community. The Night Parade of a Hundred Demons effectively declared war on Jujutsu High and baited all their sorcerers into Kyoto and Shinjuku. Meanwhile, Suguru infiltrated Jujutsu High to take on Yuta Okkotsu directly. He understood that he had less than a twenty percent chance of victory initially but confidently calculated his win percentage to far greater by capturing Rika.\n: As the name implies, Suguru's technique allows him to control vagabond cursed spirits. Dominated curses are absorbed into small black orbs that Suguru must ingest orally in order to use. If the difference in grade is more than two levels, Suguru can absorb a curse with no consequences. He's also able to absorb other sorcerer's curses as long as he kills the master first.\n: The maximum technique of Cursed Spirit Manipulation combines a massive number of collected curses into one powerful attack. Suguru used over four thousand curses in his maximum technique during the climax of his battle with Yuta and Rika.\n: A type of barrier that is cast over a large area to hide everything within it from the outside world. Suguru can cast curtains capable of trapping sorcerers inside of it and can do so over another weaker sorcerer's barrier as well.\nEquipment: A special grade cursed tool Suguru used to fight Yuta and Rika at the same time. He was effectively able to block, parry, and counter-attack against both adversaries at the same time with the three-section staff.",

She takes great pride in being both a pretty girl and a strong fighter, refusing to let anyone influence her.\nInitially, Nobara can appear to be a very obnoxious and arrogant person. She first introduced herself to Yuji and Megumi by expressing how inferior they were. She also argued with Yuji for the greater part of their first mission together. Despite her abrasive attitude, Nobara is actually an incredibly caring and dutiful person, but would never let most people see that side of her. After fighting alongside each other on several missions, Yuji and Megumi grew to become Nobara's closest allies.\nNobara leaves her village behind but promises to reunite with Fumi and Saori someday.Even from a young age, Nobara was outspoken and different from everyone else in her small town. She felt everyone was crazy and was determined to trade the small countryside to the big city. Nobara was only ever drawn to outsiders who moved into the village like Fumi and Saori, especially the latter. She looked up to Saori to a great degree and was disheartened when she was forced out of the neighborhood. Saori leaving made Nobara want to escape the village more and aspired to meet Saori again one day. Before attending Jujutsu High, Nobara made a promise to Fumi that the three of them would reunite in Tokyo.\nStaying true to who she is, Nobara carries herself confidently as a jujutsu sorcerer. Whenever Yuji and Megumi tend to be decisive, Nobara is willing to take charge even if the boys don't like it. While they're prone to panic in some situations, Nobara is able to remain relatively level-headed regardless of what's happening. Nobara loves joking around in civil situations and is a huge trash talker in combative ones, no matter who it is. Among all her peers, Nobara looks up to Maki Zenin in particular. She loves the way Maki carries herself and admires her strength as someone fighting against the oppression of their own family.\nNobara punishing Yuji for dying and resurrecting without being considerate of her.Nobara and Yuji are the two class clowns among the first years that typically annoy Megumi to for a laugh any chance they get.

Nobara dislikes Mai, which upset Momo and caused her to monologue about the gender-based discrimination in the Zenin Family.

Like Saori, Maki is a good person despite the circumstances that surround her while Mai is not. Nobara doesn't believe people are excused just because they come from a difficult background.

She passed Satoru's test with flying colors and didn't hesitate to inflict pain on herself during the  with the ,  And .\nIn order to counter Eso's , Nobara willingly stabbed herself with nails and smiled while doing it. She appeared to take pleasure in outwitting her  opponents and didn't hesitate to injure herself further in order to ensure victory and her own survival. Together, she and Yuji were victorious and ended up killing both brothers. Although Yuji was guilt-ridden over killing the brothers, Nobara was relatively unphased. She admitted that she expected killing came with the job of being a jujutsu sorcerer. Noticing that Yuji was acting strange, Nobara comforted him in her own way by claiming that they were both accomplices in the murder.\nYuji's fond memories of Nobara and their dynamic with Megumi.Nobara has a high sense of duty as a jujutsu sorcerer and is a prideful fighter.

However, Nanami refused to let her and ordered her to wait to be rescued. Nobara ignored Nanami's warning because she couldn't bring herself to leave the city while all her allies were still fighting.\nUpon encountering Mahito's double soon afterward, Nobara admitted she didn't have much to show for October 31st and believed beating him would be a solid contribution. Nobara remained confident in her strategy and managed to injure Mahito's soul, forcing him to retreat. Nobara chased him and attempted to exorcise the curse.

      "abilities": "Nobara exorcising a curse on her first mission.: Nobara is ranked as a grade 3 jujutsu sorcerer by Jujutsu High. This is mostly due to her status as a young first-year student and inexperience working as a sorcerer.\nNobara has showcased numerous times the capability to contend with jujutsu users ranked leagues above in terms of grade. Coming into school, Nobara had a solid understanding of how to exorcise curses with her innate technique. She also had the mental fortitude to handle the job but lacked physical ability. While fighting in the Eishu Detention Center, Nobara defended herself adequately until she ran out of nails to fight with.\nImprovements in physical strength allowed Nobara to compensate for her disadvantage against Momo.Afterward, Maki took Nobara under her wing and trained her to improve her physical prowess. The training included heavy stamina conditioning and getting used to getting knocked down . By the time of the Goodwill Event, Nobara showcased she was in much better shape as a close-combat fighter.\nIn Nobara's fight with Momo, the Kyoto third year had the advantage of flying above Nobara on her broom. Nobara eventually figured out a way to outmaneuver Momo by using the environment to her advantage. Nobara was able to last long enough in that fight due to Maki and Panda's training. She was knocked down several times by gusts of cursed energy wind, but Nobara endured until she figured out a way to counterattack.\nNobara embracing self-inflicting pain necessary to ensure victory.Despite ultimately being eliminated from the Goodwill Event, Nobara has since demonstrated the potential to combat special grade curses. Alongside Yuji, Nobara was able to fight on even terms with Eso and Kechizu. Both the students were poisoned by the Death Painting's blood technique, but Nobara used that connection against her adversaries. Thanks to her cleverness and ability to think clearly in high-pressure situations, Nobara instantly figured out a way to counter her opponent's technique.\nNobara's adaptability and fearlessness lead her to use Resonance on herself to injure Eso and Kechizu at the same time. This involved stabbing herself with nails to activate Resonance, but Nobara was more than happy to do so. The poison, as well as the pain from stabbing herself, helped Nobara enter a state of extreme focus, allowing her to unleash the power of Black Flash as well. Nobara and Yuji defeated the special grade curses, prompting Mei Mei (via payment from Satoru) and Todo to recommend her and all her peers for grade 1.\nNobara confidently fighting a special grade in close quartersDuring the Shibuya Incident, Nobara underestimated the curse user Shigemo and was taken off guard repeatedly by his uncanny abilities. Shigemo was landing the perfect shots on Nobara, making it difficult for her to keep her balance, let alone fight back. Thinking on her feet, Nobara got Shigemo to talk in order to buy herself some time. This led to Nanami arriving in time to defeat the curse user and rescue her.\nNobara tapping into her potential.Having little to show for the incident, Nobara continued fighting rather than retreating as she was ordered. She encountered Mahito, an opponent she had information on unlike with Shigemo. In order to combat someone of his caliber, Nobara focused on trying to reach the core of cursed energy, the same feeling that accompanied unlocking Black Flash.\nNobara was able to plan out a strategy accordingly and executed it flawlessly. She led Mahito's double to believe that she was recklessly focusing on physical damage that couldn't hurt his soul. In reality, Nobara knew she could hurt Mahito's soul if she could use his body as an effigy for her technique. After leading him into a false sense of security, Nobara struck his soul and dealt Mahito major damage. Almost immediately, Mahito recognized Nobara as one of his natural enemies in the same way he views Yuji.\n: A technique that creates spatial distortion when the user connects with an impact of cursed energy within a span of 0.000001 seconds of a physical hit. The phenomenon causes cursed energy to flash black, creating an attack that is equal to a normal hit to the power of 2.5.

Kirara fought against both of them with a lot of determination to keep them away from Hakari but was ultimately outsmarted by Megumi. Annoyed with Megumi, she claimed that for a first-year he wasn't very cute.

He describes this as people's \"fever\" burning hot. Kinji is clever and pours his own fever into manipulating others. He believes people are desperate to change their lives and an easy way of directing their fever is through gambling. He doesn't believe there is a single person that exists without the fever and his goal is to manipulate all of Japan's fever with his fight club. \n\"\"According to Kirara Hoshi, Kinji's fever burns hottest when he's working as a sorcerer for jujutsu high. However, Kinji's attitude and modern cursed technique don't mesh well with the higher-ups. He was suspended for assaulting a conservative member and decided to act outside their regulations. Kinji is willing to take advantage of the chaos caused by the public reveal of curses to advance his fight club. Eventually, his goal is to get his club recognized by jujutsu officials for the coming changes in their regulations. \nHakari changing his attitude toward Megumi after learning he's head of the Zenin clan.Kinji is only willing to put his life on the line with another sorcerer if they show him a proper fever. Initially, upon encountering , Kinji felt that the first-year's fever was weak because Yuji was sent to him on the recommendation of others. Yuji explained that he's just a cog in the system of jujutsu sorcerers, which Kinji thought was boring. However, Yuji proved he's a cog in fever, burning hot enough to gain Kinji's attention. Kinji agreed to cut a deal with Yuji and his allies simply because he believes the fever never lies.\nDespite his brash disposition, Kinji is very grateful for those who took care of him. He was fairly distraught learning that  died and Satoru Gojo was sealed, claiming he hadn't been so bummed since his friend Yakul got shot in the butt with an arrow. Yuji, , and  found this comment strange and they assumed Kinji must live a relatively calm life. \nKinji's way of encouraging Charles to pursue his dreams.Kinji agreed to help Megumi and his allies but clarified that this isn't a personal favor, but a deal between both parties. Panda asked what exactly Kinji wanted and \"sea-urchin head\" (Megumi) somewhat answered for him, annoying Hakari. He felt bad for Yaga and Gojo, but Hakari was even more surprised to learn Megumi was head of the . Almost instantly, Hakari was nicer to Megumi and asked him to be best buds in order to gain a close ally within the .\nKinji comes off as very selfish and rude, but he has a kind heart who respects other people's passions. Upon meeting , a potential enemy, Hakari was willing to hear him out over the stress caused by the . He put on a tough act and claimed to have felt weird about joining another guy on a ferris wheel and only did so to scout out the amusement park for a potential place to take a girl. Hakari was confident that Japan will return to normal while Charles believed his dreams could never be achieved under the circumstances. Charles needed to take out his rage and Hakari recognized that, so he provoked Charles by insulting his passion. After their fight, Hakari made sure to check up on Charles and even asked to read his manga. Hakari asked if Charles felt better after finding an avenue for his stress through fighting and encouraged him to keep pursuing his dreams once the Culling Game ended.\nWhile Kinji doesn't necessarily seek out conflict, he thrives in threatening situations and enjoys gambling on himself in a fight. This includes his life-or-death bout with Hajime Kashimo where they talked and taunted one another in a competitive fashion throughout. Kinji was regularly smiling and even commended his opponent for nearly killing him several times. Kinji was victorious but highly impressed with Kashimo's strength, earning his respect. He admitted he didn't feel like the winner and decided to cut a deal with Kashimo to create an alliance in exchange for what he knew Kashimo wanted most.\nSynopsis mentions to  and  that the third year student has been suspended and can't participate in the Kyoto Goodwill Event.\nGojo mentions Hakari as one of his students that can rival him in the future.\nAnalysis of the culling game is done and Maki instructs Megumi, alongside Yuji, to rendezvous with Hakari as earlier planned between them.",
      "abilities": "\"\": Hakari is widely recognized as one of the most powerful students at Tokyo Jujutsu High. Satoru Gojo, the undisputed strongest sorcerer in the world, believes that Hakari and Yuta Okkotsu will have the potential to rival his power one day. As Yuji \nstated, all of his senpai have stated that Hakari is exceptionally strong. Yuta even believes Hakari is the stronger of the two of them when he's worked up. \nKinji fighting on par with Kashimo, one of the Culling Game's most elite players.Kinji is not only an elite close-quarters combatant who possesses serrated cursed energy but an extraordinary jujutsu specialist armed with a dynamic domain. He distinguished himself in the Culling Game by defeating Hajime Kashimo, not only one of the strongest players in the death game, but one of the most powerful sorcerers Kenjaku ever encountered in one thousand years. \nKinji's domain is unique and his luck is reliable, making for a combination capable of opposing any threat. Charles Bernard could see briefly into Kinji's future but he was instantly bested as soon as Kinji hit the jackpot of his domain. Kashimo nearly killed Kinji on several exchanges but he was able to repeatedly open his domain and successfully hit the jackpot to enter his unkillable mode. Kinji's strategic thinking and expert battle sense are ultimately what complemented his techniques best and allowed him to achieve victory against Kashimo. \nKinji's brutally direct fighting style.: Kinji is an exceptionally capable hand-to-hand combatant, able to apply life-threatening pressure to Yuji, a very proficient taijutsu specialist. Yuji stopped resisting in order to win Kinji's approval and ended up suffering several blows that dealt serious damage to the first year.\nKinji's full combat prowess on display while in his unkillable mode.While his fighting style is very direct, Kinji isn't just a brawler. He's a skillful martial artist with a wide range of physical attacks in his arsenal. He uses combinations of punches, kicks, knees, and elbows among other grappling moves and strikes to take out his opponent with maximum force. \nKinji's pure hand-to-hand combat skills were enough to put pressure on Charles even while the latter could see into his future. He was so confident in his abilities that Kinji began their fight with his hands in his pockets while only defending himself with kicks. Charles acknowledged that not for his cursed technique, Kinji would've defeated him right away with physical prowess alone. \nThe full extent of Kinji's close combat prowess was on display against Kashimo, who had even more superior taijutsu technique. While Kinji's base state couldn't challenge Kashimo's mastery of martial arts}, his close combat abilities shine the most when he's amped up by his jackpot's domain. Fueled with limitless cursed energy, Kinji's taijutsu skills were on full display, enabling him to overpower Kashimo in several exchanges. Up against cursed spirits, Kinji effortlessly tore a swarm of them apart with his bare hands.   \nKinji attacking Charles' blindspots to counter his ability to see the future.: Kinji doesn't present himself as a fighter with a plan because he's fearless and straightforward. That being said, Kinji is an experienced sorcerer with a high strategic battle sense and a knack for reading his opponents. Upon learning about Charles' ability to see the future, Kinji immediately attacked to confirm how it works and then quickly came up with the countermeasure. He knew Charles needed to see his target to use this ability and decided to attack Charles's blindspots with relentless pressure. Kinji also predicted that Charles would counter by attacking his own blindspots and acted accordingly by parrying his attempts. Even inside his domain, Kinji knew Charles still had a slight advantage and kept the pressure on to prevent him from focusing on the future. \nKinji proactively using his auto-healing to avoid death.While he is a relatively cerebral fighter, Kinji tends to recklessly abandon tactics when he's in his unkillable mode. He allowed himself to be hit by Kashimo during a surge of cursed energy because the assault barely hurt his reinforced body. Despite the lack of caution, Kinji's recklessness does often work in his favor. Immediately after his arm was dismembered by Kashimo's lightning, Kinki continued his own offense because he knew the unkillable mode would regenerate his arm. This took Kashimo off guard and allowed Kinji to retake the momentum of their duel. Kinji's unkillable mode comes is rooted in a fully automatic reverse cursed technique but he doesn't overly rely on the involuntary healing factor and knows how to best make use of it. When Kashimo attempted to destroy his head in one shot, Kinji voluntarily ejected his opponent's cursed energy while allowing his reverse cursed technique to heal him while he breaks.   \nKinji dropping Kashimo into the sea to forcibly discharge his electrified cursed energy.After being hit by Kashimo's electric discharge twice, Kinji figured out there must be a trick to the attack and assumed his opponent couldn't launch it again. Acting on this assumption, Kinji decided to recklessly go full force on his offense and attempted to defeat Kashimo within the eight seconds before his unkillable state ceased. This backfired because Kashimo developed a loophole for his attack that Kinji was unaware of, nearly costing the latter his life. However, on the verge of death, Kinji was able to remain focused and did the only thing he could in order to survive, using all of his strength to bank on expanding his domain, a gamble that ultimately paid off. \nAs Kinji's fight with Kashimo began to draw out, he switched his approach from a straight-on brawl to a more tactical one. He shifted his domain over the ocean before the barrier dispelled and dropped Kashimo into it, correctly assuming that the water would forcibly draw out his electrified cursed energy. While fighting in the ocean, Kinji carefully considered his options of either returning to the surface or using his last five seconds of immortality to finish the fight. Kinji's recklessly decided to try to finish Kashimo off, only to end up on the receiving end of a steam explosion. He survived thanks to quick and clever thinking, using a last-second binding vow to sacrifice his left arm so the rest of him would be unharmed. Kinji knew Kashimo grabbed onto his arm before initiating the explosion in case he survived, which would've made Kinji unable to make the hand signs to cast his domain again. With this information, Kinji wisely decided to sacrifice his arm entirely and used the cursed energy reinforcing it to protect the rest of his body. As displayed at the end of their battle, Kinji's cleverness and forward thinking are what allowed him to best Kashimo in the end. \n: While Kinji is an extremely gifted sorcerer, more so than any of his skills, he's extraordinarily lucky. He's as fortunate as he is talented and can comfortably rely on this to win fights. Kinji's domain is based on drawing a jackpot with only a 1/239 chance of doing so, yet he claims to have never needed to spin more than thirty times. It only took him two spins to hit the jackpot against Charles and he hit it twice in a row on the first try against Kashimo. The second time, Kinji was mere moments from death and needed an immediate jackpot in order to heal himself. His good fortune pulled through and even Kashimo was forced to admit that Kinji truly has incredible luck.",

Even while Mechamaru was trying to kill him Panda continued to poke fun at his fellow cursed corpse. It took Mechamaru nearly destroying Panda's body for him to even become \"kind of mad\".

The only way to take him down is by destroying the cores of cursed energy that act as his heart. Additionally his body is extremely durable and can be reinforced using jujutsu protection. \nPanda stunning Aoi with a powerful right hook.: Due to the size and sturdiness of his body, Panda is naturally very physically strong. He can exorcise curses with simple blows, effortlessly carry allies on his back, and run clean through walls as a few examples of his base strength.

      "personality": "Nanami is a very wise and reserved kind of man, often appearing so calm and indifferent that he comes off as stoic and aloof. He seems like the kind of person who's too serious about his work, but Nanami just knows how to separate sentimentalism from service. He's blunt and straight to the point in most conversations and doesn't care for impractical optimism or questions left open to interpretation.\nNanami's stoic personality in contrast to Satoru.Additionally, Nanami is very avid and quick to express his irritation, either on his face and verbally with his words. Nanami is often very impatient. He hates working overtime and is very serious about not going a single minute over what's required of him.\nBeneath his tough exterior, Nanami is actually quite sociable and doesn't mind intelligent conversations. He's practical and overly serious to an almost comedic point on occasion as well. He claims he only became a jujutsu sorcerer because it's slightly less idiotic than being a salaryman. In the role of one of Yuji's mentors, Nanami is a very big contrast to Satoru, who is far more outspoken and easy-going. Yuji and Satoru describe Nanami as \"gloomy\" and the former didn't believe they would get along at first.\n\"\"Nanami is just a normal man weighed down by the mundane day-to-day practices of life that stole his youth from him. Nanami doesn't believe age or life-threatening experience propels one into adulthood. Instead, he feels that it's the build-up of all the little inconveniences throughout life that transform people into adults. He initially treated Yuji as a child because he didn't want to see him abandon his youth for the sake of being a jujutsu sorcerer. However, Yuji eventually proved himself and forced Nanami to acknowledge him.\nNanami expressing his irritation and impatience.Nanami knows being a jujutsu sorcerer is a dangerous and demanding job for crazy people, and so he has a hard time respecting people in the profession. Even though Nanami and Satoru are longtime friends, the former claims he doesn't respect Satoru despite their mutual trust in one another. He returned to being a sorcerer from the life of a salaryman because he never felt truly appreciated and didn't believe his work had any significant impact on anyone. In contrast, work as a sorcerer allowed him to build up small bits of appreciation from innocent people. For Nanami, this was more than enough to allow him to live without regrets.\nNanami had a similar yet naturally less mature personality while he was a student at Jujutsu High. He saw missions as a burden but his negativity was always offset by his classmate 's extreme optimism. Haibara's death affected Nanami greatly and likely played a role in his initial decision to leave life behind as a jujutsu sorcerer. One of the reasons he believes jujutsu sorcerers are trash is because they must force their comrades to accept that they must willingly sacrifice themselves. He recognizes that this lead him to \"run away\" from the profession, admitting that it's a more befitting phrase than suggesting he \"quit\". Nanami wants to believe he's never been frustrated by his own uselessness, but many of his failures haunt him, such as allowing Haibara to die.",
      "abilities": "Nanami recognized as a model example of what it takes to be a grade 1 sorcerer.: Nanami is a model example of what a grade 1 jujutsu sorcerer should be. Yuji and  both look up to Nanami for his demeanor when actively approaching a difficult situation as well as his incredible skill when it comes down to solving it. Satoru Gojo entrusted Nanami with looking after Yuji due to these traits as well and it paid off well for Yuji's growth. Ino, a powerful grade 2 sorcerer, approaches every tough decision with \"what would Nanami do\" in mind because he believes Nanami always handles things the right way.\nNanami making short work of his target, slicing through them with great speed and precision.When it comes to combat ability, Nanami is capable of fighting on par with special grade  such as . While Mahito was still in the infancy of his existence, Nanami was able to keep up in several of the exchanges. With a lack of information on Mahito's ability, Nanami suffered a direct blow to his soul but was still able to survive, something no one Mahito faced before had been able to do. Mahito himself considered Nanami to be exceptionally strong and a worthy opponent, far stronger than the average sorcerer.\nDuring the , Nanami showcased his leadership ability alongside great intellect and fighting strength. Upon learning about Satoru's sealing, Nanami was able to deduce what would be the best move for his team and helped carry out 's rescue plan without delay. Understanding that  and the managers are crucial for communication in a large-scale mission, Nanami went alone to put protocols for the operation in place while also delegating the others on another task.\nNanami fighting on even terms with Mahito, a special grade curse.Following finding Ijichi injured, Nanami was quickly able to track down the culprit, , and beat the  senseless without so much as suffering a scratch. This performance in particular was stunning to , a very capable grade 3 student. Watching Nanami fight helped her understand that he's on a completely different level and that embodies what it means to be a true grade 1 jujutsu sorcerer.\nNanami dispatching a swarm of transfigured humans despite his grevious injuries.Alongside  and , Nanami was also able to fight the special grade curse . They were able to overpower him mostly thanks to Naobito's incredible speed backed up by Nanami's support. However, not even the two grade 1 sorcerers were able to exorcise him.\nTrapped inside Dagon's , Nanami was unable to take any offensive position whatsoever. However, he miraculously survived Dagon's endless stream of   for over a minute, something that surprised him the domain's caster. Once  arrived and nullified Dagon's automatic hit with his own Domain, Nanami focused on protecting Megumi and was easily able to dispatch any shikigami that tried to attack the student despite his injuries. Despite being heavily injured by Dagon and later burned by Jogo, Nanami massacred an entire swarm of transfigured humans attempting to kill him.\n: Nanami mainly utilizes a blunt sword in battle and does so with incredible proficiency. Combined with his , Nanami can cut through anything, including a blocking opponent that is using  to defend themselves. Nanami wields his blade with grace and balance, striking with extreme speed and precision with every swipe of his sword.\nNanami completely dominating Shigemo in close quarters combat.: In addition to being adept at armed combat, Nanami is an extremely capable unarmed fighter as well. His innate technique works with his fists as well as it does with his blunt sword. Nanami used this method to effortlessly overpower the curse user Haruta Shigemo. Each of Nanami's blows were incredibly devastating, a simple backhand was enough to send Shigemo flying across the room. There was never a point in the fight where Nanami was any danger fighting at close range, he delivered one bone-shattering blow after another and Shigemo would have died if not for his cursed technique.\n: Nanami's greatest assets in battle outside of his cursed technique are his astute fighting instincts and deductive reasoning skills. Both times he fought Mahito Nanami knew he was outmatched in terms of raw cursed energy, however, he survived both accounts and overwhelmed Mahito on several occasions thanks to quick thinking and masterful execution.\nNanami instantly realizing his situation inside Mahito's Domain.When Nanami was assigned Mahito's case, he was able to effectively utilize his team to track down the proper clues that eventually lead them right to Mahito. He was also able to recognize that Mahito was purposely leading them into his hideout, and decided to go alone to prevent harm from coming to the others.\nDuring their first encounter, Nanami eventually realized his cursed technique could not win against Mahito's. As a countermeasure, Nanami used the environment around them to pin Mahito down. In their second fight, Nanami quickly realized that Yuji could land attacks that actually damaged Mahito. Instantly, Nanami came up with a strategy to overwhelm Mahito together that completely worked, and if not for Mahito's sudden evolution, would have killed the special grade cursed spirit. At the mercy of Mahito's , Nanami was able to instantly assess his situation and what it meant for Mahito's advantage.\nHow Shigemo felt attempting to kick Nanami.: Nanami is incredibly durable for a human even by sorcerer standards. As previously mentioned, he was able to survive being touched by Mahito's Idle Transfiguration and continued to fight and eventually escaped with his life and body intact. When Shigemo fought Nanami he attempted to cut and kick him right after. However, Nanami was unscathed from the slash and didn't move as much as an inch from the curse user's kick. Shigemo compared hitting Nanami to a stone wall and said it felt like he wasn't even hitting a person. Additionally, Nanami was able to survive an endless swarm of man-eating fish shikigami for over a minute and was attacked by Jogo shortly after that. He was miraculously able to survive both and was even able to continue fighting, unlike Maki and Naobito who were completely incapacitated and near-death.\n: Nanami is an extremely technical fighter who plans on using his every move to exploit an opening in his opponent. His aim is always extremely precise, as he never misses his target's weak point when it's exposed by his cursed technique. Against stronger opponents, Nanami fights by breaking them down and creating constant weak points until they eventually fall. This same level of precision allows Nanami to evade his opponent's attacks with clever maneuvers. For example, by sticking his sword into a wall, Nanami was able to raise his legs high enough to avoid a ranged attack from Mahito.\n: Nanami has remarkable levels of cursed energy for a jujutsu sorcerer. He can utilize his innate technique while reinforcing his body with cursed energy without showing any signs of running low. His control over his cursed energy is also shown by his ability to assign a Binding Vow to himself and limit it for a given amount of time. Even after being injured by Mahito, Nanami's cursed energy rose to levels that even intimidated and excited the special grade. Against Mahito's Idle Transfiguration, Nanami subconsciously guarded his soul with cursed energy to survive the initial impact with his opponent's innate technique.\nNobara and Shigemo both immediately felt Nanami's presence when he took over their fight. His overwhelming cursed energy froze them both up and got their full attention as he walked through the door. Shigemo attempted to cut Nanami but having already reinforced his body with cursed energy more than sufficed to avoid being cut. It was so effortless that Shigemo couldn't even figure out what happened.\n: A technique that creates spatial distortion when a user connects with an impact of cursed energy within a span of 0.000001 seconds of a physical hit. The phenomenon causes cursed energy to flash black, creating an attack that is equal to a normal hit to the power of 2.5. Before Yuji fought Hanami, Kento Nanami was the record holder for most consecutive uses of Black Flash. He claims he got lucky.\n: Nanami's signature Binding Vow with himself. Nanami limits the amount of cursed energy he can utilize during the time he's officially on the clock working for Jujutsu High. Once he goes beyond his normal shift and overtime hours begin, Nanami's cursed energy swells to a great degree and grants him a boost in fighting power.\nWhile working his normal hours, Nanami suppresses his cursed energy to about 80-90%. By invoking Overtime, Nanami exerts 110-120% of his maximum power. Nanami can actively break the vow and use 100% of his cursed energy at any given time, but using Overtime in that case would only result in a 1% increase.\n: Nanami's Innate technique can divide his target with ten lines and forcibly create a weak spot at the ratio point of seven to three. The target's lines don't have to match up with the target's length or wingspan. Nanami can freely choose which part to divide, including the subjects, head, torso, arms, and legs. This technique is also applicable to non-living objects.\nEquipment",

      "appearance": "Yuta is a young man of average height with disheveled black hair and dark blue eyes. As a first-year, Yuta's body language made it obvious that he was under a lot of stress. His posture was very unconfident, and he still has dark circles under his eyelids from a lack of sleep. As a second-year student, Yuta's hair has grown longer and he wears it in a more relaxed style instead of a spiky one. \nAt his old school, Yuta wore a suit for their uniform. He sported a long-sleeve shirt that stops at his forearms or a black t-shirt and dark green pants for casual wear. After transferring to Tokyo Jujutsu High, Yuta received a specialized uniform. Yuta has a loose white uniform jacket with sleeves that stop at his forearms. He also wears slender blue jeans that tuck into white sneakers that match his jacket. Yuta also often carries his katana case on his back.",
      "personality": "\"\"Yuta was a very timid and lonely boy who was bullied a lot while growing up. Due to  haunting much of his early life, Yuta was unable to connect with other people and has lost all confidence in himself. This makes it difficult for Yuta to interact with others, as they often scare him without meaning to, or he's just too shy to speak to them.\nEven so, Yuta genuinely cared about other people and decided to isolate himself from them even if it means remaining alone.  called Yuta out for being a moody kid who's lived his entire life without goals. He acknowledged that this was true and used her advice to gain a resolve for being a jujutsu sorcerer. This helps Yuta realize that deep down, he truly desires the confidence to feel like he belongs. \nYuta learning to understand and become friends with others.While his timid nature stays intact, Yuta slowly becomes more social and interacts with others normally. Even after early signs of improvement, Yuta still struggled to understand someone like . He was initially scared of Toge until he realized how kind of a person he truly is and made an effort to establish a social connection.  \nYuta's rage unleashed by the sight of his injured friends.Gaining friends helps Yuta gain confidence in himself and establish the goal to help set Rika free. He felt responsible for her turning into a curse in the first place and worked extremely hard to find a way to help her. He pushed himself during training and took all his friends' and mentors' words to heart, showing a more determined side of himself. At his core, Yuta wants to become someone who can help keep others out of danger. \nAgainst , Yuta showed the darkest side of himself. Geto hurt Yuta's only friends, and the young man was more than willing to kill him for it. Yuta's rage allowed him to even command Rika's power at will. He was willing to sacrifice his life to use Rika to kill Geto to avenge his friends, the only people who give him the confidence to continue living.\nYuta adopts an apathetic persona in order to deceive others into thinking he wants to kill Yuji Itadori.When Yuta returned to Jujutsu High after time away overseas, he was accompanied by a new Rika and it appeared as if he was lost in his darkness. He agreed to kill Gojo's other pupil,  for the higher-ups and claimed it was revenge for cutting off Toge's arm. Yuta carried a deathly serious and cold persona who was straight to the point. He attempted to kill Yuji before so much as exchanging words and then apologized while committing the act.\nHowever, this was all an act to help protect Yuji from the higher-ups. Yuta had to act a certain way to make it believable and he healed Yuji before the first-year died permanently. Even though Yuta has never met Yuji, he went out of his way to deceive authority and help Yuji because Gojo asked him to. Yuji is important to people who are precious to Yuta and that was more than enough reason for him to help. He also sympathizes with Yuji because he was in the exact same situation, up for execution bearing a power he could not hope to contain. Yuta doesn't blame Yuji for 's actions. \nYuta sympathizes with Yuji's situation and protects him in Gojo's place.Without the false guise of a cold killer, Yuta is still a naturally friendly person who has developed a lot as a person. He's much more social and is less timid than he used to be. When Gojo visited Yuta in Africa, the outspoken teacher was surprised his student was even telling jokes. \nYuta assimilated comfortably back into interacting with his peers and dedicated himself to helping them. He agreed to help Megumi rescue his sister from the . He also did his diligence as a senpai and agreed to stop Sukuna should he ever take control of Yuji's body again. Upon reuniting with Maki, Yuta was excited to see her and expressed concern about her injuries. \nDue to his absence in Shibuya, Yuta shoulders the responsibility of stopping Kenjaku alone.When it appeared as if 's barrier had rejected their group, Yuta was concerned and quick to suggest they turn back because Megumi's sister didn't have time to waste. Once Tengen allowed them inside and provided crucial information, Yuta agreed to enter the Culling Game right away by himself. He also suggested they get 's help despite his moodiness and was modest enough to say that Hakari's strength sometimes surpasses his own.\nDuring the Culling Game, Yuta displayed his selflessness as well as his propensity to be ruthless. He had no gripes about killing enemy sorcerers to obtain the necessary points to help save Tsumiki. Yuta killed at least seven sorcerers before cutting down  and he targeted the latter simply because he was a danger to the public. He believed that any potential danger couldn't be allowed to leave the colony and only took out the other players when it was completely necessary. \nYuta trying to understand why someone with great strength would act so desperately for their own sake.Not only did Yuta use his strength to score points, but he used it to protect people as well. He protected a group of civilians caught up in the Culling Game, serving as their guardian throughout the game despite the risk to himself. While trying to move them to safety, Yuta noticed a mother and her daughter struggling to go on. He insisted on carrying their belongings himself and changed his mind about moving the group, deciding they should take a break inside Dhruv's former territory where they'd be safe instead. When other civilians outside his group were threatened by 's cockroaches, Yuta didn't hesitate to try his best to save them.  \nYuta holds some guilt about being unable to help his comrades in Shibuya. He's aware that everyone reached their limit after the Shibuya Incident and felt as if he needed to shoulder the responsibility to handle the Culling Game all on his own. This also extends to the Night Parade of a Hundred Demons where Yuta was unable to finish off Geto. Yuta doesn't want his beloved sensei to have to kill his best friend again. As a result, Yuta resolved not only to score four hundred points all on his own, but to kill Kenjaku himself as well.\n\"\"Upon encountering  and , two players who are dangerous but not necessarily evil, Yuta tried to reason with them. In Uro's case, Yuta tried to understand why she would kill so desperately for her own gain. He expressed that he understands why the powerless get desperate but doesn't get why someone strong like Uro would seek out pointless battles. Yuta only gained friends recently but he believes fighting to protect someone or something is the only reason to do so. Uro rejected Yuta due to his lineage, but he still tried to help her understand that regardless of what the Fujiwara did to her, living selfishly will only get someone so far.\nAs for Ryu, the incarnated sorcerer expressed over four hundred years of yearning for a proper battle, and his sincerity managed to melt Yuta's heart. Although Yuta will likely never find any meaning in fighting, he indulged Ryu and gave him the fight he always desired. Yuta spared both Ryu and Uro and ignored their ungrateful insults after the fight. When Ryu asked about Yuta's conversations with Uro, he explained that they could never come to terms simply because he's blessed. Yuta knows how fortunate he is to have friends and the power to protect them. Ryu suggested Yuta might've killed them if not for their points and while Yuta didn't deny it, he told Ryu to just be grateful to his comrades in the end.",
      "abilities": "Yuta's presence when he was completely unable to control Rika.: Yuta is one of only four special grade sorcerers recognized by Jujutsu High. While being haunted by Rika's vengeful spirit, Yuta was immediately registered as a special grade due to Rika's immense power, making him the most recent person to receive the ranking. \nYuta was completely unaware of how to fight or control his  when Satoru threw him into his first mission. He relied on Maki until they were swallowed by a curse and it came down to Yuta to rescue everyone inside. Yuta was able to tap into his emotions and fully manifest Rika, ripping the other curse apart and freeing everyone. Yuta barely carried everyone outside the barrier but he used what little physical strength and stamina he had to finish the mission.  \nAfter training with Maki, Yuta becomes more capable with a katana.This made Yuta painfully aware of how weak he was, so Maki trained him on the basics of armed combat for three months before his next assignment. He was never able to land a hit on Maki but always trained hard to improve himself and started to move a lot better. However, in his second mission, an exorcism with Toge, Yuta still found himself relying on his classmate's skill. When a semi-grade 1 curse ambushed them, Toge was injured saving Yuta. Yuta stepped up on his own without relying on Rika and helped Toge exorcise it. Yuta's training allowed him to avoid most of the cursed spirit's attacks and he even landed a counterattack. It was just a shallow slash, however, due to the toughness of the curse and Yuta's poor cursed energy control at the time.  \nApparently, during the 2017 , Yuta completely dominated all of the  competitors, including . There is no record of him fully manifesting Rika at that time but Maki noted she was still around and was likely the reason Yuta won the event.  \nYuta converting emotions into strength while fighting alongside Rika.Continuing training throughout his tenure at Jujutsu High, Yuta continued to grow stronger and built a solid foundation as a sorcerer. On December 24, 2017, Suguru Geto targeted Yuta and injured his friends while invading the school. This set Yuta off, unleashing extraordinary levels of cursed energy throughout through his body. This resulted in a mighty increase of Yuta's physical abilities and fine-tuned of his senses.   \nAlongside Rika, Yuta was able to match Geto one-on-one. He revealed not only the ability to use the extremely rare reverse cursed technique but the capacity to copy other cursed techniques like  as well. This led Geto to claim he was glad that he attacked Yuta before the student learned to properly wield Rika's power. Yuta was only able to defeat Geto by vowing to give his life one exchange for removing the limiters on Rika's boundless power, ultimately overpowering  and . The major difference in their battle was that Yuta was willing to give his life to win while the cursed manipulator didn't have the vast majority of his curses, with over four thousand serving the Night Parade of a Hundred Demons.   \nYuta and Rika fighting in sync to combat the extradoinarily dangerous Geto.Following his victory, Yuta discovered he was the one who cursed Rika when they were young, not the other way around. He is a descendant of , one of the greatest sorcerers to ever live, making Yuta a distant relative of the . Yuta severed the bond tying servant to master and Rika didn't desire to punish him, so the curse was broken, freeing Orimoto's soul. \nYuta originally thought that after Rika passed away he wouldn't be able to be a sorcerer anymore.  believes that Yuta's vast cursed energy and his ability to copy cursed techniques were tied to detaining his loved one's soul. However, these are incorrect assumptions and Satoru Gojo has stated on more than one occasion that Yuta still has the potential to surpass him.  \nYuta taking out cursed spirits on his own upon returning to action.By March of 2018, only three months after the Night Parade of a Hundred Demons, Yuta regained his rank as a special grade sorcerer. He is a prodigy who boasts incredible power and unusual abilities second only to Satoru Gojo. Satoru forced Geto's comrade, Miguel, to train Yuta. Miguel mentored Yuta overseas while they searched for the . By the time he returned to Tokyo following the Shibuya Incident, Yuta was able to dispatch large cursed spirits without much effort.   \nUpon arriving to execute 's vessel, Yuta was recognized as a major threat to everyone. , , and , three strong jujutsu users, were all briefly stricken by Yuta's unsettling cursed energy. Naoya, who especially prides himself on his abilities, was quick to ally himself with Yuta in order to avoid any potential conflict. Choso, another special grade, told Yuji to run away immediately because he could feel Yuta's overwhelming strength is on a scale similar to Satoru Gojo's, ensuring death.   \nYuta's overwhelming offense leaving Yuji with no choice but to dodge.Following Choso's advice to get away from Yuta, Yuji attempted to flee but Yuta was able to run him down and engage his target one-on-one. Due to what occurred in , Yuji was holding himself back, and Yuta was easily able to overpower him. Yuta displayed more overall cursed energy then their sensei as well as reinforcement techniques far beyond the average sorcerer. Yuji's normal reinforcement was no match for the amount Yuta was enhancing his own body with, leading the former to evade attacks most of the fight. Following his victory, Yuta found Choso after he defeated Naoya and knocked him unconscious with a single blow. \nIn addition to mastering close combat skills, Yuta has become a proficient user of reverse cursed technique. After executing Yuji, Yuta instantly restarted his heart by outputting reverse cursed energy into him. His ability to output reverse cursed energy at will is something even Satoru is unable to do. \nYuta overpowering a special grade curse without using the full extent of his abilities.Yuta only showcased a small portion of his abilities against Yuji and yet his very presence intimidated the likes of Naoya and Choso. He displayed the full extent of his powers during the Culling Game, where Yuta was matched up against some of the strongest players the deadly battle royal had to offer. He effortlessly dispatched , an incarnated sorcerer who once conquered Japan, single-handedly shattering the four-way deadlock in the Sendai Colony. Yuta likely could've also made short work of Kurourushi if he had chosen to use reverse cursed technique from the beginning. However, Yuta handicapped himself to avoid displaying his abilities to those observing him and still managed to overpower the cockroach curse in multiple exchanges. Yuta was eventually cornered and nearly defeated but he ultimately exorcised the curse using a calculated maneuver that blasted Kurourushi's head with reverse cursed energy. \nYuta using his full power to fight alongside Rika.Yuta put up fierce resistance against Takako Uro and Ryu Ishigori directly after defeating Kurourushi. He used reverse cursed technique and his cursed energy manipulation to survive their attacks but could hardly go on the offensive against their cursed techniques. In order to ensure victory, Yuta went all out and showcased the full extent of his abilities. Utilizing Rika and his full skillset, Yuta completely took over the momentum of the battle and overpowered both his opponents, forcing them to rely on domain expansion. Yuta cast his own domain in response, displaying his capacity to use the supreme jujutsu art as well. Even after the domain struggle resulted in everyone being unable to use cursed techniques for a limited time, Yuta still excelled and was directly involved in eliminating Uro and Kurourushi's offspring from the fight. Yuta's advanced reinforcement techniques gave him an edge over Uro and his reverse cursed energy was used to easily dispatch Kurourushi's offspring. \nYuta giving Ryu the fight of a lifetime.Ryu proved to not only be the strongest among the participants of the four-way deadlock but the toughest opponent for Yuta as well. His cursed energy output could even bypass Yuta's toughness and his directed blasts were far superior to Yuta and Rika's. Yuta was able to achieve victory due to his growth as a fighter, made abundant by his tactical awareness and the ability to contend with the experience of a four-hundred-year-old being like Ryu. By copying Uro's power to control space, Yuta turned his opponent's own destructive force against him. Even without Rika backing him up, Yuta bought enough time for his plan to succeed by matching Ryu in close combat. Once Yuta was victorious, Ryu proudly admitted that Yuta gave him the most satisfying fight he's ever had, proving that Yuta's strength surpasses that of the vast majority of jujutsu sorcerers, past or present.\nYuta slicing his way through a swarm of curses.: While first training as a sorcerer, Yuta was given a katana mainly as an object to stabilize his cursed energy. Through vigorous training with Maki, the most proficient cursed tool user at Jujutsu High, Yuta became decent with a sword, able to hold his own against cursed spirits and even Geto, who has exceptional physical prowess. \nYuta effortlessly executing a powerful sorcerer with his katana.Yuta has continued to hone his skill as a swordsman and still wields a katana as his weapon of choice. His skills have improved dramatically and are perfectly balanced with his enhanced cursed energy manipulation, allowing Yuta to wield a blade with superhuman physical prowess. He's fast and makes decisive attacks that Yuji could barely avoid. The blade is constantly surging with cursed energy just like the rest of Yuta's body, giving it superior cutting ability. He defeated a large cursed spirit with a diving stab so powerful it cracked the ground beneath them.  \nYuta cut down Dhruv Lakdawalla using his katana and fought on even terms with Kurourushi using it as well. Rika has gained the ability to store cursed tools, implying Yuta is now capable of utilizing a wide variety of weapons. He chose a steel arm attachment to fight Takako Uro and used it to further reinforce his close combat skills.\nYuta leaning on his close combat prowess.: Yuta has grown into a very capable hand-to-hand combatant who is more than comfortable engaging his opponent's up close. He generally throws single powerful smashing blows that can crush his opponent in a single move. A mere front kick to Yuji's sternum was enough to send him reeling back and one backhand from Yuta knocked Choso out cold. \nYuta employs hand-to-hand combat consistently against extraordinary opponents in the Culling Game. He used his katana to disarm Kurorushi before hitting the special grade cockroach curse with a powerful backfist. Yuta fought the early stages of his battle with Takako Uro and Ryu Ishigori entirely barehanded against their powerful cursed techniques.\n: Yuta is a smart individual but was initially a complete novice sorcerer and could hardly apply his intellect to battle. However, he's always had a good idea of his skillset and how to best use it. When he and Toge were faced with a semi-grade 1 curse, Yuta was aware he couldn't win on his own and focused on restoring Toge's cursed speech so he could exorcise it. \nYuta fooling the jujutsu higher-ups by \"killing\" Yuji.Currently, Yuta is entirely capable of solving most conflicts with brute force, but now he has the experience to properly apply his intellect to battle. He also uses his wits to navigate other situations in the jujutsu world, such as when he was selected to execute Yuji. Yuta entered a binding vow with higher-ups and managed to fool them by stopping Yuji's heart and immediately healing him with reverse cursed technique. He was aware very few people knew about his ability to output reverse cursed energy and that Yuji had \"died\" and returned to life before. Thanks to his act, Yuta fooled the higher-ups and took Yuji off their radar.\nYuta defeating Ryu with his own attack.Yuta displayed his cleverness and intellect in battle when he was faced with exceptionally strong fighters in the Culling Game. While being observed by other players, Yuta knew it was in his best interest not to display his full power. He did his best to try to avoid using Rika and reverse cursed technique while fighting Kurourushi, only doing so when his life was in immediate danger. While trying to restrain showcasing his own strengths, Yuta was keen on figuring out his opponents. After a quick exchange with Takako Uro, Yuta was able to grasp the basics of her complex innate technique. Ryu's wide attack range led Yuta to close the distance and bring their battle in close. While approaching Ryu, Yuta fooled his opponent by using a hole in the path toward his opponent that he created early to create the perception he had been struck down. \nAt full strength, Yuta applies his intellect to ensure an efficient victory. His heightened fight awareness enabled him to counter Takako's ability to redirect attacks by using cursed speech to immobilize her first.  He also immediately noticed her concern over Kurourushi and utilized it to land an unguarded hit, ultimately leading to her defeat. Yuta defeated Ryu by copying Takako's technique and using it to redirect his own blast back at him, an attack the latter never saw coming.\nYuta retains the massive amounts of cursed energy that were unraveled from Rika's curse even after her spirit passed on. His cursed energy capacity exceeds even that of Satoru Gojo. Yuji and Choso could immediately feel that Yuta's volume of cursed energy was comparable with Satoru, with the former claiming it was more creepy and ominous. Ryu Ishigori, the Culling Game player with the highest cursed energy output, felt Yuta's cursed energy was nearly bottomless.  \nNot only are Yuta's attacks unpredictable upon reading his cursed energy, but his physical capabilities are enhanced tremendously. Yuta's strength and agility are improved to such a degree that he can contend with Yuji's superhuman prowess. Yuta's every attack carries enough destructive power to end a fight and his defense is so dense that it can restrict all incoming damage to a minimum.\nIn addition to his superior reinforcement technique, another testament to Yuta's delicate control over his cursed energy his is mastery over reverse cursed energy. Reverse cursed technique is notoriously difficult to perform for sorcerers but Yuta can use it repeatedly without issue.\n: Yuta compensates for his small physical frame by strengthening himself with cursed energy. This reinforcement to his physical power is enough to put him on par with Yuji's superhuman strength. When Yuji punched a car at Yuta, he was able to throw it right back at him. A mere front kick to Yuji's sternum was enough to send him reeling backand one backhand from Yuta knocked Choso out cold. While fighting in the Sendai Colony, Yuta effortlessly ripped a steel railing from the side of the road and threw it at Kurourushi. He also threw a downward punch at Ryu Ishigori so ferocious that despite being blocked with cursed energy, the impact created a larger crater in the ground.\n: Improving his muscles' performance with cursed energy allows Yuta to greatly increase his speed, agility, and meneuverability. He can keep pace with Yuji's superhuman speed even with a drawn katana. While closing the distance across Sendai in his fight with Ryu Ishigori, Yuta ran at incredible speed across an open area. He was able to perform acrobatic spins and parkour moves across the environment that helped him evade Ryu's cursed energy beams.\n: Thoroughly fortifying his body with cursed energy has made Yuta extremely tough. He can leap from the top of a building and crumble the side of the road from the impact without doing any damage to himself. Coupled with his ability to heal himself, Yuta comes off as near invulnerable to even the strongest assault. He tanked several blastwaves from Takako Uro and Ryu Ishigori's Granite Cannon head-on without sustaining and prolonged injuries. Proper defensive martial arts made him able to withstand Ryu's explosive cursed energy output. Ryu compares hitting Yuta to knocking against a massive water tank. Yuta was even able to deflect one of Ryu's beams with his bare hands and kept fighting after suffering several direct hits from Ryu and Uro. This made Uro recognize how tough Yuta is. Consistently reinforcing his body and healing it with reverse cursed technique helped Yuta stay in the fight, but it was still draining on his stamina and overall cursed energy.\nRika can partially manifest and lash out on her to protect Yuta without him commanding her to do so. She normally acts on Yuta's commands but she can act independently at a fair distance away from Yuta to perform separate tasks as well. It doesn't require Yuta to use any intense emotions to call Rika and she can appear rather quickly, allowing Yuta to call her to his side at any moment's notice. Rika maintains her same trademark power as well, able to immobilize Yuji with ease and crumble a bride with a single strike.  \nYuta has since become more proficient with cursed speech. While connected to Rika through the ring, Yuta can even make the Snake Eyes and Fangs insignia appear on his mouth as if he was born with it. This allows him to activate the technique by speaking commands in the same manner that Toge does. \nWhen faced with the dire injuries of his friends, Yuta was able to tap into the core of his cursed energy and unlock the ability to heal their injures with a reverse used technique. He did so after less than a year's worth of experience in jujutsu. While most sorcerers can't use a reverse cursed technique and even less can output it, Yuta was able to learn to do both. \nSince first using it to heal his friends Yuta has become a highly proficient user of reverse cursed technique. Yuta was able to apply it to Yuji at the same time he stopped his heart to prevent a permanent death. Shortly after he healed Naoya of his injuries and Choso's poison, which takes a higher level reverse cursed technique to remove toxins. While fighting in the Culling Game, Yuta used reverse cursed technique constantly to heal himself after getting hit by any big move. This helped him avoid long-term damage but severely drained his cursed energy. He also used it to exorcise Kurourushi, compromising the cursed spirit's body with a blast of reverse cursed energy.\n: Yuta had very poor understanding of cursed energy or how to control it upon enrolling at Jujutsu High. The focus of his early training was to stabilize his cursed energy by channeling Rika's power into his ring and then into his katana. He had a lot of trouble with this and asked his peers for help. While fighting Geto, Yuta was running on lots of adrenaline and more cursed energy than he had experienced up to that point. While he was able to fight with reinforced flesh with on a high level, Yuta accidentally broke his katana by imbuing excessive cursed energy into it.\n : When Yuta and Rika Orimoto were children, Yuta accidentally cursed Rika's death by consciously rejecting it. This transformed Rika into an immensely powerful vengeful spirit, who only ever fully manifested twice, but is known to be one of the most powerful cursed spirits to have ever existed. \nYuta didn't know how to control Rika as she haunted him through his early years. She was extremely overprotective of him out of love, what Satoru believes is the most twisted curse of all Rika would partially manifest her arms and attack anyone who was too aggressive with Yuta. Her massive amounts of cursed energy directly fed Yuta's abilities and could be molded into any cursed technique. Fully manifesting the first time, Rika tore a large cursed spirit to pieces with little effort. Unleashing her power at full force, Rika was able to contend with every cursed spirit in Geto's arsenal at the time. Beyond the limits of her power, Rika was able to overpower Geto's maximum technique. \nRika Orimoto's curse was successfully broken and her soul unbound from the ties of cursed energy, allowing her to pass away to the afterlife. However, Rika's form as a cursed spirit remained with Yuta as a different entity altogether.\nEquipment",

She had fringes of hair over her forehead with smaller strands framing her cheeks and used to sport different pairs of glasses that allowed her to see curses. \nWhile still a member of the Zenin clan, Maki wore a traditional outfit, a white yukata, and a black hakama. Maki's original Jujutsu High student uniform consisted of the traditional long sleeve jacket with a skirt. As a first-year student, she wore thick, long tan socks and black shoes with her uniform. As a second-year Maki wore a different pair of glasses and sported black leggings instead of socks.\nWhile training for the , Maki wore a purple tracksuit a black jersey with tan shorts over her leggings. While training , Maki wore the same top with darker shorts. Her casual clothes consisted of a white hoodie over a black and white horizontal shirt, white shorts over black pants, and white boots. \nMaki was severely burned by 's flames during the . This has left a great deal of her body covered in scars from the severe burns, running all the way up and down both her arms and the sides of her face. Her hair now only reaches just past her ears, which may be a result of her cutting it, or it may have been partially or entirely burned off. And overtime from training while she recovered from her injuries developed a more robust physique than before. \nMaki decided to alter her uniform to keep her arms mostly uncovered. She wore a sleeveless, turtle-neck, black shirt underneath a large cape attached by two Jujutsu High pins on each side. The shirt tucked into a large brown belt with a gold buckle, tied around the waste of tight black pants. The glasses she paired with this outfit were circular but Maki's right eye was covered in bandages from the burns.\nDuring her conflict with the Zenin Family, Maki lost her right eye altogether and now has a scar where it was sliced by her father's katana.

She is extremely strong-willed, capable, and motivated to escape the standards that have been set for her by people who are supposed to be her family. \nIn a sorcerer clan, strong  are everything, but Maki couldn't even see curses. Women in sorcerer clans have to stand out even more, leading Maki to be constantly severely mistreated and abused by the Zenin clan. Despite feeling cursed by her own blood, Maki motivates herself to become a strong sorcerer regardless of what her family thinks. She wants to break apart the foundation of their way of their life and reject it completely. \nMaki yelling at Yuta for getting them in a troublesome situation.Maki can come off as rather cold at times, even to her classmates. She is the leader type but Maki is very tough on others and tends to be impatient and hot-tempered. Maki doesn't seem to respect Satoru Gojo as a person due to his very goofy attitude. Even as her teacher and senior, Maki often refers to him as a moron. She was initially very mean to  because of his shy attitude and openly told him he had no business attending Jujutsu High as a . \nWhile working on a mission together, Maki and Yuta learned to understand one another and she realized they weren't so different. She asked Yuta why he enrolled in the school and he told her that he wanted it to be acceptable for him to live. Maki told him that's what Jujutsu High is all about and encouraged him to use his  to save people. \nMaki encouraging Yuta to use his curse to help people.Maki trained Yuta harshly because she wants to see him get stronger and fight beside her. Something she would later impart on to Megumi and Nobara as their senpai. She's taught them all highly advanced situational awareness and how to properly wield a variety of weapons, even if they had to get beaten up a lot in the process.\nMaki has repressed many of her emotions to maintain her trademark tough exterior. She hasn't expressed romantic interest in anyone and  enjoyed teasing her about this as first-years. When it came to Yuta, this embarrassed Maki enough to lash out at Panda in a temper. \n\"\"Following their first encounter with , Maki and Yuta talked about why Geto referred to her as the \"failure of the Zenin clan\". Maki initially played it off as if being born a non-sorcerer gave her a perfect excuse to leave because she hated the clan for a variety of other reasons. When Yuta inquired as to why Maki chooses to be a sorcerer and Maki said it's because she's got a bad personality and wants to be a grade 1 sorcerer to spite the Zenin clan. \nYuta admires Maki's strength and revealed he wants to be like her, strong and resilient. Yuta awkwardly offered to help her stick it to the Zenin clan but called him an idiot and said it was something she needed to do alone. She had spent so long rejecting the need to feel accepted that she became flustered that Yuta kindly recognized her strength. Maki left the conversation to gain her composure and then reminded herself that she should not go feeling like she's finally been recognized. \nMaki embarrassed after accidentally portraying herself as a \"cold-hearted demon\".As a second-year student, Maki carries an aura of leadership and guides her juniors appropriately. She gravitates toward  because he's also an ex-member of the Zenin clan and they get along well. She's comfortable with teasing him even if it's harsh and this can make her come off as a \"cold-hearted demon\" at times. When she found Megumi sulking with , she jokingly asked them if they had just attended a funeral. However, this was ironically after their classmate, 's death. This made Maki feel really guilty and as usual, she lashed out at Panda in a rage for not informing her sooner. Even after the accident, Maki was still unsure if taking it easy on the first-year students would've even been a kindness.\nMaki is someone with a chip on her shoulder and is always determined to prove herself. For the , she needed strong teammates to help showcase her abilities on a public stage where she couldn't be denied. She encouraged Megumi and Nobara to get stronger for their fallen ally and figured it was the perfect opportunity to put her juniors in their place.\nMaki annoyed with Megumi's attitude.Maki doesn't appear to be concerned with the moral aspects of being a sorcerer and is more focused on personal goals. While training, Megumi asked Maki what kind of people she wanted to save as a sorcerer but she doesn't think about that kind of stuff. This clearly annoyed Megumi which in turn angered Maki. She decided to compromise and told Megumi they could talk about it if he improved his skills in hand-to-hand combat enough to challenge her.\nAs a child, Maki promised her twin sister  that she would stay with her forever. However, as Maki grew older she realized she couldn't live under the thumb of the oppressive family while Mai was content with doing so. Leaving Mai behind led the only person Maki cared about in the clan to resent her as well. Mai was punished for Maki leaving by getting pressured into becoming a sorcerer even though she wanted to live a normal life. She grew to hate Maki by the time they were both in Jujutsu High. \n\"\"Mai treated Maki as if she was worthless because she lacked significant cursed energy. This is the same type of ridicule most of the Zenin clan threw at Maki all her life, so it didn't appear to bother Maki all that much. In the stance where Mai and Nobara got in a fight, Maki told her twin that they were both worthless because Mai isn't that talented herself, only able to charge weapons with cursed energy. \nThis revelation surprised Nobara, who asked the same question Yuta did, why would Maki want to become a sorcerer. Maki simply told her that she wanted to prove her family wrong by becoming a great sorcerer. Nobara expressed her profound respect but Maki didn't make a big deal out of it. During the planning phase of the Goodwill Event, Maki overheard Nobara telling  about her circumstances and how they have to win to prove the Zenin clan wrong. At the time, it annoyed her, but only because Maki doesn't want the others to worry about her. Recalling her classmate's acknowledgment of her ability, later on, made Maki smile. \nMaki couldn't stay with Mai at the clan because she would've hated herself.Maki didn't actively try to repair her relationship with Mai and engaged in their sibling rivalry to a degree. After defeating Mai, Maki is asked to explain why she didn't stay at the bottom and fall down the hole with her sister. This saddened Maki, who replied that she would've hated herself and apologized to Mai for leaving. Maki walked away without a clear resolution and continued the event, leaving their relationship still fractured.\nIn spite of their troubled past, Maki was able to operate cordially on missions with other members of the Zenin clan. She shared a squad with the head of the clan during the Shibuya Incident.  was acting very lazy in Shibuya so Maki took over the leadership role to help guide Nobara and . She would tell them to ignore him whenever he would ask for anything off mission. \nMaki and Naobito stirring up tension on their squad.Maki and Naobito eventually split off and met up with , and were quick to stir up tension with each other. Naobito mentioned that he wouldn't mind if Satoru stay sealed and Maki told him to leave Shibuya if he wasn't going to be any help. Naobito argued that Maki should be the one to leave and Nanami agreed that the fighting in Shibuya had escalated to a degree far too dangerous for her. She ignored this and claimed she'd be more help than a drunk like Naobito, causing Nanami to become more annoyed with him for drinking on the job. However, this was before Maki ever saw Naobito's capabilities as a sorcerer. She and Nanami were taken back by Naobito's speed and Maki even begrudgingly admitted that Naobito saved her life against . This was humiliating for Maki but she continued to fight in sync alongside Naobito and Nanami in an attempt to exorcise the cursed spirit. \n\"\" - Maki thanking Megumi.Maki doesn't take well to taunts and is quick to insult anyone back regardless of who they are. Inside his , Dagon called Maki the weakest there. After surviving a hard hit that surely injured her, Maki responded by bolding taunting Dagon and confronting the special grade directly again. Maki told the \"octopus\" that if he's going to call her weak, then he should've killed in her with that one hit. Maki was also annoyed with herself for not taking  out earlier in preparation for tougher battles instead of waiting for permission. She was happy to see Megumi when he invaded the domain and gave her Playful Cloud. She smiled and her way of expressing gratitude to her junior was calling Megumi a cocky brat.\nMaki asking Megumi to become clan head because she's can't create a home for Mai yet.Maki was severely scarred and injured as a result of the fighting in Shibuya, but she's not the type to ever make a big deal out of it. Yuta reunited with her after some time and expressed his concern but Maki claimed she was fine. When Yuki acknowledged what happened and commended Maki's toughness, Maki simply replied that it was not like she was going for it. \nEven in a team of unlikely allies compiled to combat the , Maki's leadership skills helped everyone keep in line with their roles for rescuing . She was the one who suggested that Yuji and Megumi recruit Hakari despite his bad attitude because their group is shorthanded and needs all the help they can get.\nMaki forced to let go of Mai just moments after reconciling.When the opportunity presented itself for Maki to push for head of the clan, she couldn't bring herself to do so. With Naobito's death, Megumi became head of the Zenin clan due to a special clause. Megumi didn't want to accept the position but Maki implored him to do it. She tried to convince him of all the luxuries that came with being clan, but typical Megumi refused and asked her to do it instead. Irritated, Maki told him no one would accept her and started yelling, listing off all the reasons Megumi would make a decent head before adding barely at the end. Megumi refused still and argued acceptance wouldn't matter but Maki wasn't just good enough to them, but good enough for herself either. Maki believed she still wasn't able to make the clan somewhere Mai could feel she belonged. \nMaki's complicated relationship with her family was on full display when she returned to the Zenin clan to collect cursed tools. Despite having the clan head's permission, Maki was still constantly harassed on her way there. She ignored both  and her mother's harsh words and pressed on to the vault. Maki's  conspired against her, attempting to execute Megumi along with the twins. Maki fought against him bravely and tried to save Mai, but was defeated and gravely injured, leaving Maki to be the one saved by Mai. \nMaki ruthlessly executes her promise to destroy the clan.Maki was forced to say goodbye to her sister too soon, marking a massive change in her personality. Inside a dream-like space, Mai explained that she was going to sacrifice herself while distancing herself from Maki. During that conversation, Maki listened to Mai's explanation but she was constantly trying to close that distance. She didn't want to let go of Mai, before they ever truly got a chance to reconcile, but was forced to accept this was the end. In exchange for Mai giving everything to ensure Maki reached her potential, Maki promised to destroy everything. Maki was devastated by her sister's death but had no time to mourn and had to carry out Mai's request immediately, killing their father in cold blood. Immediately after, Maki was ready to continue and looked to the last thing her sister left for her, a sword. With a cold and remorseless disposition, Maki looked to the sword and told Mai \"\". \nMaki's cold and merciless disposition towards her clan after losing Mai.Maki ruthlessly annihilated the entire Zenin clan without any expression of emotion. She slaughtered every member of the Hei and the Kukuri unit present that day without a hint of remorse. The only words she exchanged with anyone were with Naoya when he asked if she had a human heart. This was after she decapitated  and tossed his severed head into a pond. Her reply was simply: \"\". He also tried to call Maki an imposter during their fight but Maki interrupted him by smashing his face with a punch. Then she taunted him by asking him if he could repeat that statement.\nIn the midst of her ruthless tirade, Maki still wanted to believe there was good left in her family. Before killing her own mother, Maki attempted to see if her mom was trying to warn her about Ogi's trap back when she harassed Maki upon her return. However, Maki was assuming the best of her mother and appeared disappointed when she didn't get a fortunate answer. Maki's own mother fell way to her vengeful wrath and even after that, Maki left Mai's body with  and killed off the rest of the clan members who weren't present that day.\nAt this point, Maki had grown exponentially since enrolling at Jujutsu High and Noritoshi could tell that she changed at a glance. However, she grew content being more like her peers, and was unable to maximize her potential. She lacked the perception same  possessed and struggled to understand what she was missing to make her like . While normally relaxed and focused, Maki became tense and frustrated. Maki was self-aware enough to recognize that she was overthinking and accepted 's offer to sumo wrestle in order to blow off some steam. Maki never truly had anyone she could sincerely recognize as a teacher because she views Satoru and Atsuya as idiots. She never rejected the idea of having a teacher due to pride, it just never crossed her mind to rely on anyone else to grow stronger. Maki put her trust in Miyo and explained what was holding her back. Through sumo wrestling, Miyo taught Maki how to free her mind and perceive everything around her without the pressures of the world on her shoulders. With that newfound freedom of the mind, Maki smiled and proudly declared that she was at her best.\nMaki advising Noritoshi not to make the same mistakes she did.Maki's enlightened mental state allowed her to bring out her full fighting potential. She regained her calm and focused demeanor along with a newfound sense of freedom and confidence in herself. She realized it wasn't enough to be like everyone else and needed to focus on what she could do specifically, things only she and Toji could achieve. Maki was completely nonchalant during the latter stages of her fight with Naoya's cursed spirit form as he became the increasingly frustrated one. Maki didn't bother acknowledging Naoya's antics a single time and effortlessly took him down. In one last conversation with her sister, Maki is able to confirm that she's broken anything that shackled her, just as Mai intended.  \nDespite everything Maki has been through, she remains loyal and kind to her friends. Although she and Noritoshi weren't close before their time in Sakurajima together, Maki could relate to him due to their complicated familial relationships. Maki told Noritoshi to talk with his mother before assuming she doesn't want him. After learning Naoya was killed by her mother, Maki admits maybe she was wrong about her and never got a good answer as to what a mother is. She emplored Noritoshi to find out for himself and not to make the same mistake she did.",
      "abilities": "Maki easily exorcising curses.: Maki's grade 4 ranking is not at all reflective of her actual skill level. She was born a non-sorcerer but she has always had tremendous physical abilities, gifted through  in exchange for her severely low cursed energy. By mastering the use of weapons and studying curses at Jujutsu High, she has become a jujutsu sorcerer nonetheless. \nSatoru Gojo and  both casually agreed that as a second-year students, there was no good reason Maki wasn't ranked at least grade 2. Maki's tension with the Zenin clan caused them to stall their promotion even though she can exorcise a grade 2 cursed spirit with ease. \nMaki using her natural battle prowess to close the distance on Kasumi Miwa.Maki's close peers all recognize how powerful she is, Yuji Itadori could tell just by looking that she has an aura of strength. Even so, she's still often underestimated by her opponents. She wields quality cursed tools with proficiency and her heavenly restricted physical prowess is second only to Yuji's superhuman abilities.\nMaki outclassing her sister in combat.In the 2018 Goodwill Event, Maki made short work of both  and Mai one after the other. Kasumi realized Mai was dead wrong about calling Maki a weakling and believed she'd exorcise a grade 2 curse with ease. In a fight between weapons users, Maki effortlessly overpowered Miwa and took her katana from her. Mai did her best to use tricks to overcome her sister, but she was also forced to recognize that Maki's physical abilities far surpassed her own. Against , the special grade cursed spirit that invaded the event, Maki was able to hold her own with Megumi's help and bought enough time for reinforcements to arrive. \nMaki also proved herself an asset in the harrowing battles of Shibuya despite Naobito and Nanami telling her to turn back. She was a step slower than the seasoned grade 1 sorcerers at the start of the fight with Dagon and Naobito rescued her at one point, but Maki continued to improve throughout the battle. Inside Dagon's domain, Maki survived his early onslaught and even launched an effective counterattack against the special grade with Megumi's aid. \nMaki proving her strength against Dagon inside his domain.Fighting against her father, Maki was able to overwhelm her opponent in a sword duel, but Ogi ultimately cut her down using jujutsu. As Mai explained, Maki was never able to reach her full potential because what little cursed energy she had was only holding her back. Twins are treated as the same person in jujutsu and Mai was the one born with the innate cursed technique. In exchange for sacrificing her life and taking all the cursed energy between them with her, Mai was able to free Maki from cursed energy and grant her a body of steel.\nMaki using her improved heavenly restriction to slaughter the entire Zenin clan.Maki's heavenly restricted body was immensely improved, to the point where her strength is comparable to . She effortlessly killed her father in an instant and then went on to annihilate all of the clan's strongest fighters. Maki slaughtered every member of the Kukuru Unit when they had her completely surrounded. Then the Hei immediately ambushed her with all their cursed techniques only for Maki to destroy all of them with a single cursed tool.\nEven Naoya, who inherited Naobito's  and refused to accept Maki could be Toji's successor in strength, was bested by her new power. Maki has surpassed Naobito, who once saved her. She has showcased the ability to eliminate one of the Big Three Sorcerer Clans and she can't be tracked now that she has no cursed energy at all. \nMaki gained a body of steel but mental shackles held her back from maximizing her potential until she changed her mindset. While she was strong enough to eliminate the Zenin clan, she struggled against Naoya when she fought him as a vengeful curse in Sakurajima. She couldn't close the gap in abilities between herself and Toji because she had become content being like her peers and didn't allow herself to thrive in areas only she could excel at. After some guidance from Rokujushi Miyo, Maki freed her mind and realized she could perceive inorganic matter. This advanced perception allows her to see how her opponent will move due to the subtle changes in temperature and air density. She can even take hold of these scattered surfaces to move in mid-air at extreme speeds. She was also completely immune to Naoya's domain expansion and effortlessly killed him. Twelve years after his death, a war god equal to Toji Zenin has been fully realized in Maki. \nMaki's proficiency with her favored polearm type weapon.: Maki is touted as the best cursed tool user at Tokyo Jujutsu High. Able to wield a wide assortment of different weapons, Maki has mastered all sorts of armed combat styles. She appears to prefer using polearms and spears in battle but is fully capable of switching between multiple weapons in the course of a single fight. \nMaki training Yuta to use a sword.Maki's proficiency with weapons is also shown in her ability to teach others to use them. She helped give Yuta a strong base for close combat by training him to use a katana. He became a decent sparring partner after three months and he eventually blossomed into a talented swordsman. Maki is also responsible for teaching Megumi how to fight in close quarters. He was extremely lacking at the beginning of his first year at Jujutsu High but she has shown him how valuable close-quarters combat is. She helped him realize he could keep weapons in his shadow and motivated him to learn how to fight with a variety of different types of weapons.\nIn the Goodwill Event, Kasumi was surprised that Maki could wield a wide polearm in the middle of a forest where their duel was surrounded by trees. Maki broke the handle of her own spear and used it as a projectile to close the distance. Using aikido disarming to take an opponent's weapon, Maki stole Kasumi's sword from her. \nMaki and Megumi comfortably swapping weapons in the midst of battle.Maki used the katana to attack Hanami and although the blade shattered on the first strike, Maki was able to quickly adapt and switch to the three-section staff, Playful Cloud, to fight. Megumi noted that Playful Cloud was difficult for him to use Maki was able to utilize it to fight on par with special grade cursed spirits. She and Megumi swapped weapons a few times against Hanami to take the curse by surprise and were able to do so comfortably. \nMaki parrying Naoya's high-speed punches while reading the timing on his technique.: Maki is well trained in several forms of close-quarters combat and generally uses hand-to-hand in tandem with her weaponry. While her hands are generally occupied fighting with weapons, Maki likes to throw kicks at the same time. While fighting Mai, Maki sliced apart her foothold with a katana then delivered a devastating kick to her sister's body that tossed her through the air. \nUnlike Yuji, Maki generally didn't get to showcase her martial arts skills because she requires cursed tools to be a sorcerer. Maki did, however, use hand-to-hand combat to best many members of the Zenin clan with her improved body of steel. Chojuro and Nobuaki were both killed with Maki's bare hands and she defeated Naoya with a single punch after parrying many of his early high-speed attacks. \nMaki figures out the trick to Naoya's cursed technique.: Maki was raised in one of the major sorcerer clans so she has a solid grasp on the important aspects of the jujutsu world. While generally looking to overpower her opponents with her physical skills, Maki is also a highly intelligent fighter. She has proven leadership skills and gives effective orders within her squad to work together as a unit. As the de-facto leader of the Tokyo Team in the Goodwill Event, Maki came up with the strategy to counter 's one-track mind and brute strength. She and Megumi were also quick to figure out the Kyoto Team's formation was targeting an assassination on Yuji. In Shibuya, it was her plan for Nobara and Akari to leave the barrier and rescue .\nAgainst her father, Maki formulated a good plan to win a sword exchange with Ogi. She feigned a single-strike duel and then followed up with more attacks that broke Ogi's katana. She defeated Naoya by constantly analyzing his cursed technique and looking for the secret to his speed, which she was eventually able to figure out.\nMaki using a special grade cursed tool to contend with Hanami.: Maki has always possessed extraordinarily high levels of strength for a human. She knocked out Aoi Todo with a baseball to the face and broke a wooden polearm over her thigh, something no normal person is physically capable of. As a testament to her heavenly gifted strength, Playful Cloud is a cursed tool that relies solely on its user's power. She was able to use it to damage two powerful special grade cursed spirits on her own.  \nAs with all of her physical abilities, Maki's strength grew tremendously after her cursed energy was completely taken away. It is more than enough to fight back against cursed techniques. Maki easily broke free from the stone hands attack that  hit her with and broke free from 's paralysis using brute strength and willpower. Compounded with the speed Naoya was approaching her at, the brute strength in Maki's left hand crippled the right side of her opponent's face to end their fight.\nMaki catches a speeding bullet.: Maki has incredible speed to match her strength and moves well enough in a fight for her agility to be acknowledged by Hanami. She makes sharp moves, and stays highly mobile in a fight with great precision. Against Mai's revolver, Maki effortlessly dodged and weaved through her sister's barrage of bullets. Not only did she slice a bullet in half with a katana, Maki even moved fast enough to catch a speeding bullet just a few centimeters from her face using incredibly astute reflexes. \nAfter escaping from cursed energy, Maki's body could move and react fast enough to compete with Naoya's Projection Sorcery, which allowed him to break subsonic speed. She killed Chojuro and  before either of them even knew what happened. In their last moments, both noted how Maki's speed had grown so much she had become unrecognizable. Once fully realized, Maki's speed has reached inconceivable levels for a human being. Naoya, a curse that can move three times the speed of sound, was unable to catch her. \nMaki survived being burned alive by Jogo.: Although she never had an effective resistance to curses, Maki has always been tough. Her inborn physical toughness saved her life when she was burned point blank by Jogo's . No amount of curse tolerance saved Naobito from similar injuries. \nWhile Maki was very durable, she was eventually sliced open and incapacitated by her father. Maki's improved body of steel healed her injuries and came with highly improved durability that overpowered the Zenin clan's cursed techniques with pure physical prowess. Maki suffered a direct hit from Chojuro's giant stone hands smashing together, something Nobuaki believed should've completely immobilized her, and broke out of the stone just a few moments later. \nEquipment",

      "appearance": "Yuji is a young man of average height and appears to have a slender build when wearing baggy clothing, but actually has a lean and muscular physique. He also has relatively large light brown eyes and spiky pink hair (brownish blonde in the manga) that's styled in an undercut fashion. When becoming the vessel for  after eating his finger, he gains a second pair of eyes that only open when Sukuna controls his body along with his many markings.\nAt the start of the series, Yuji wore a light-colored hooded jacket, high-cuffed black pants, and white shoes. However, in the anime, his pants were denim, and his shoes were bright red. When Yuji enrolled into the Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical College, he began wearing his version of the uniform; a black long sleeve shirt resembling a gakuran over a red hoodie, black pants, and red shoes.\nHe gains a noticeable scar between his two eyes and a smaller scar on his left labial commissure of the mouth during the Shibuya Incident.\nHe lost the second pair of eyes that only open when Sukuna controls his body along with his many markings after the latter transferred to  as his new vessel.",
      "personality": "Yuji is a fair person who truly cares for not only his comrades but anyone he views as people with their own wills, despite how deep or shallow his connection to them is. He highly commends \"the value of life,\" and to this end, he will ensure that others receive a \"proper death\". Because of this, he believes that it is morally unethical for him to take another human life, and tries to avoid any possibility of doing so unless as a last resort. \nHe is also not without his more energetic and outgoing traits. Such as his frequent comedic moments where he was seen alongside Nobara gushing about Tokyo and his eagerness to train with Gojo or even when entertaining both Junpei and his mother. Yuji is also highly passionate whenever he's focused on achieving certain goals and being quite stubborn when confronted about them, such as when Yaga questioned why Yuji wanted to become a sorcerer. He is also quite naïve due to his inexperience in the world of cursed spirits and jujutsu sorcerers, but is shown to be a quick learner, capable of adapting to his surroundings and picking up how to use cursed energy quickly.   \nAlthough usually composed, good-natured and friendly, Yuji can be angered quickly in the face of pure malice after witnessing firsthand the cruelty that curses were capable of, particularly Mahito's inhuman exploitation of Junpei. Yuji felt so profoundly disgusted that he felt a genuine desire to kill for the first time in his life and has a very intense yet focused hatred towards the cursed spirit.\nOne of Yuji's defining traits is his willingness to sacrifice himself for others, triggered by his grandfather's last words to him to die surrounded by others. When he and Megumi were under the threat of being killed by a curse, Yuji impulsively swallowed Sukuna's finger to exorcise the curse and save them despite having met Megumi for the first time on that day.",
      "abilities": "Yuji contending with a Special Grade curse.: Yuji is one of his school's most powerful and talented students,  placing him on the same level of potential as Yuta Okkotsu and Kinji Hakari as one of the three students who he believes will surpass his strength. Despite having no connections to the jujutsu world before a few months prior to the , Yuji is able to contend with and defeat  and  curses. Yuji was gifted with superhuman physical abilities which he masterfully combines with his . Yuji is also able to contain Sukuna with no ill effects. This enables him to harm Mahito, whose control over the shape of his soul otherwise renders him resistant to injury.\nYuji using his superhuman strength.: Yuji is quite powerful even without the usage of , as he can destroy walls with ease, throwing a lead ball with enough force to bend a soccer goalpost, and has also been able to throw a car. As powerful as he is, especially when it comes to fighting, his exceptional strength can often be augmented to further levels with the usage of both the  and the  allowing him to exorcise cursed spirits. His unique strength has also been compared to , a Grade 1 sorcerer. He can even harm  and , two curses who have remarkable durability and toughness with the former being near-impossible to damage. During his fight with Sukuna, Yuji jumped twenty stories from two buildings to reach Sukuna after the latter took control over Megumi's body. Also in his fight with Sukuna, Yuji was able to kick a massive chunk of rubble towards Sukuna momentarily stopping the curse spirit.\n: Yuji is shown to have great speed and can finish a 50-meter track within 3 seconds, implying he can run at speeds of 60.12km/h (37.3mph). He's also been shown to dodge the attacks of all five opposing sorcerers from the students from Kyoto School who tried to murder him. He has been shown to be fast enough to evade 's , which travels at the speed of sound, proving he has superb reflexes. During Yuji and Maki's fight against Sukuna while possessing Megumi, Yuji was able to keep up with their magnificent speed and reflexes while being grievously wounded from his previous battle.\n: Yuji's durability surpasses the average sorcerer. He was able to continuously take hits from Choso during their fight and even Piercing Blood, an attack moving at the speed of sound didn't pierce Yuji immediately. He was also able to withstand numerous attacks from  in his  form and continue fighting. After  took control over 's body he punched Yuji through multiple buildings and Yuji survived that, and afterwards was able to fight him and even survive Sukuna relentlessly attacking him with Cleave and dismantle and keep fighting him with 's help.\n Fitting his other superhuman capabilities, Yuji possesses a large amount of stamina and has often been shown continuing to fight despite grievous injuries for longer periods of time without rest. Such as when his hand was severed and having his fingers disintegrated when battling the Finger Bearer allowing for Megumi to escape with Nobara. He was also able to resist several poisonous stab wounds from when he tried to stop Junpei from hurting anyone at his school. Especially afterwards when he is also sustained damage from Mahito and was able to still able to go on the attack.\n: Yuji is a curious person and an earnest student. He is also good at progressing - being quick at 's Movie Appreciation Training, and realizing 's advice quickly. According to , he is the best at cooking among the first years trio. He was able to master using martial arts alongside cursed energy and honed it to a level with which he can take on Special Grade curses. He was even able to use   four times in a row a short time after he had even learnt of its existence.\nYuji's martial arts skills.: Yuji is one of the greatest, if not the greatest practitioner of martial arts in the series. With his fighting prowess go toe to toe with Aoi Todo, another extremely proficient martial artist and can effortlessly defeat a  cursed spirit, and challenge  curses purely using martial arts and infusing his style with cursed energy. Yuji also possesses an impressive control over his attacks, being able to pause his punch a moment before impact and adjust his power into several counter blows. \nYuji's fighting style is usually depicted as being very acrobatic with his movements, allowing him to strike his opponent in several different angles which also allow him to evade several oncoming attacks. Essentially giving him great offensive and defensive capabilities, especially if the initial strike he is going for has been blocked he is able to use high flying kicks, unorthodox punches, and even a  knees strike to retaliate. He is also skilled in a martial arts style known as, . Which grants him the ability to perform the , which is an ancient martial arts technique that eliminates starting movements and allows Yuji to release his knees, hips, and shoulders to guide him to his opponent's feet instead of falling down.   \nBy combining the technique mentioned above with Taido Martial Arts, Yuji can perform a , where he uses the momentum to throw his right leg upwards and land a kick to his opponent's head. By adding cursed energy to this attack, it can harm cursed spirits.\n: Since Yuji is the host to Sukuna, he has a resistance to all kinds of poison. Yuji will feel the pain from the poison, but he is mostly unaffected. This ability was first demonstrated during his fight with Junpei when he could resist Moon Dregs' poison.\n: Yuji was not trained in the use of weapons; however, due to his physical power and talent, he can still become proficient with one quickly.\n: Yuji's cursed energy originates from the parts of the special grade curse, . He doesn't seem to have an innate technique, but he has shown great proficiency with learning how to control cursed energy. \nCurrently, Yuji primarily uses cursed energy combined with his martial arts skills and superhuman strength to reinforce his strikes, increasing their impact and allowing him to hurt curses.\nThanks to the various regimens of training he had, Yuji has better grasped the nature of cursed energy than most of his peers. By the time he's had his rematch with Mahito during the Shibuya Incident, Yuji managed to learn how to use Black Flash practically at will.\nYuji has an unnamed Binding Vow with Sukuna. The King of Curses agreed to revive the boy after his apparent death in the Cursed Womb Arc under two conditions:\n① Yuji would allow Sukuna to take over his body for one full minute when the cursed spirit would chant \"Enchain\".\n② He would forget about the agreement.\nYuji initially opposed the Binding Vow, making Sukuna promise that he wouldn't kill or hurt anyone during that minute. The boy still disagreed with the terms and instead had a battle against the King of Curses, where he'd allow the agreement to occur if he lost. Sukuna effortlessly defeated Yuji, forcing him into the Binding Vow.\nEquipment",

While sneaking inside the , Megumi wore a black hoodie and matching pants with his normal shoes as a disguise.",
      "personality": "Megumi irritated with Gojo's playfulness.Megumi is a very outwardly stoic, aloof, and calculating individual. He usually has a neutral facial expression that he rarely changes and appears to take every situation seriously. This contrasts with Yuji, Nobara, and Satoru's outgoing and goofy personalities, which often annoy Megumi. He's easily irritated and Yuji has noted that Megumi seems like he's always slightly angry. \nMegumi's resolute sternness even as a child.Even as a child Megumi was very stern, earnest, and thoughtful, to the point where Satoru questioned if he was really a first-grader at the time when they first met. When Satoru first explained the situation with the Zenin clan, Megumi revealed he didn't care about his father and assumed that he and Tsumiki's mother were done taking care of them. He was able to understand that he had been sold to the Zenin clan but only agreed to go if Tsumiki would be happy as well. \nMegumi has always been annoyed by Satoru's attitude ever since they first met. He didn't care for the idea of becoming a sorcerer and became more jaded about it over time. By the time Megumi reached middle school, his impersonal attitude had fully set in. He thought becoming a jujutsu sorcerer would be pointless as he didn't see himself as someone who saves others. Megumi was uninterested in making friends but he believed the basis of human interaction was avoiding violating someone else's dignity. He would beat up school bullies who ignored this rule to feed their egos, gaining a reputation as the biggest troublemaker in school as a result. Tsumiki wanted him to stop getting in fights but Megumi didn't listen and wrote her off.\nMegumi bullying the bullies in middle school.Megumi hated bad people with unearned pride just as much as he did good people who were too merciful to the former. Tsumiki is a perfect example of a good person to Megumi, but he was annoyed with her hypocrisy whenever she would get upset at him for hurting bad people. Megumi eventually realized that he was acting immature and was wrong to think that way. He surmised that Tsumiki was simply choosing to protect him in the same way he was choosing to help others. Tsumiki believed that Megumi's lack of forgiveness was his way of showing kindness. After Tsumiki was cursed, Megumi was filled with regret and found the drive to become a sorcerer so he could save her.  \nMegumi and Yuji disagreeing about retrieving the body of a criminal.As a jujutsu sorcerer, Megumi developed his own sense of justice and is steadfast in his personal interpretation of right and wrong. Like his mentor, Megumi refuses to be influenced by traditions within the jujutsu world. Yuji should've been executed when it was discovered he was able to incarnate , but Megumi ignored the rules and made a personal request to Satoru to protect Yuji. However, Megumi was unsure for a while if he made the correct decision. During the mission to the juvenile detention center, Yuji mentioned how reliable Megumi was for saving people but Megumi appeared uncomfortable with that statement. Yuji wanted to return 's corpse to his mother but Megumi disagreed and said to leave him behind. Tadashi's criminal record made Megumi believe he wasn't even worth saving when he was alive. While arguing with Yuji over the circumstances, Megumi pointed out that saving as many people as possible runs the risk of them hurting others in the future. This directly contrasts with Megumi saving Yuji despite knowing the danger Sukuna poses. When Yuji asked why Megumi saved him if that was the case, Megumi was unable to give an immediate answer. \nWhile fighting against Sukuna, Megumi pondered the aforementioned question of why he rescued Yuji. Megumi believes that the only thing that's fair about life is how it's unfair to everyone and that jujutsu sorcerers are just a cog in karmic retribution. He wants more good people like Tsumiki to receive fairness and that's why he decides to save people unfairly. This helped him realize that he didn't save Yuji because it was logical, he did it because he didn't want to see a good person die. He knows it was a selfish and emotional decision but Megumi is okay with that because he's not a hero, he's a jujutsu sorcerer. This is why he's never regretted saving Yuji, not even for a second. \nMegumi's admission of his reasoning for saving Yuji led the latter to sacrifice himself to stop Sukuna. Afterward, Megumi visited Tadashi's mother and admitted that he wasn't sure about saving him. Megumi was able to retrieve Tadashi's name tag and gave it to his mother, apologizing for being unable to rescue him. Ms. Okazaki asked him not to apologize, but Megumi was clearly remorseful about the incident. He returned to Jujutsu High shortly afterward and asked  what kind of people she wanted to save, only to be annoyed by her response. \nMegumi and Nobara vow to get stronger for their fallen friend.Megumi and Nobara weren't particularly close after their initial meeting, but Yuji's premature demise brought them closer together. It was the first time either of them lost a friend in battle. While neither of them reacted emotionally over his death, Megumi noticed that Nobara was clearly bothered and they were both saddened by what occurred. While introducing Nobara to Maki, , and , Megumi mentioned that  is the only senpai he sincerely respects. Megumi and Nobara both agreed to participate in the  to honor their fallen friend, swearing to get stronger no matter what.\n judges everyone by their response to \"what kind of girls do you like?\", including Megumi. Despite being generally uninterested in answering, Megumi responded to this question to try and avoid conflict with Todo and  during the leadup to the Goodwill Event. He told Todo he doesn't have a preference as long as his partner is compassionate, but Todo was bored to tears by this response and beat up Megumi for disappointing him. Despite being clearly outmatched, Megumi never backed down.\nMegumi and Nobara mortified by Yuji's surprise resurrection .Megumi and Nobara were mortified by Yuji's surprise return, quite the opposite reaction he was expecting. Nobara was upset by Yuji's inconsiderate return while Megumi was concerned by her reaction. Without Yuji mentioning it, Megumi was able to tell that something traumatic happened to him while he was away. Yuji tried to play it off but Megumi was able to see right through him, maintaining stern eye contact until Yuji admitted it. They both subsequently agreed never to lose again as a result of their experiences. \nDuring the Goodwill Event, Panda apologized to Megumi for not including a rematch against Todo in their team plans, but Megumi was completely indifferent about it, disappointing Panda with his dry response. When Megumi surmised the Kyoto Team was targeting Yuji, he immediately moved to confront  and asked him about it directly about it. He knew the Big Three Sorcerer Families would want Sukuna's vessel out of the picture, but Megumi has no loyalty to the Zenin clan. Noritoshi believed that he and Megumi would eventually become pillars of the Big Three Families and treated him with a familiarity that made Megumi uncomfortable. While Noritoshi thought they were similar and it was their duty to kill Sukuna's vessel, Megumi completely disagreed. Untethered to the conservative ideals of sorcerer clans, Megumi stated that he doesn't care about being right or wrong and that he only believes in his own conscience. Determined to follow that conscience and to save people unfairly, Megumi told Noritoshi that if they disagree, then they would simply have to agree to curse each other.\nMegumi's secretive nature annoying Yuji and Nobara.Megumi already considered Yuji and Nobara comrades and friends by the time of the Goodwill Event, but he was very distant with them. They knew very little about one another personally because Megumi chose not to share much about himself. During their mission to his middle school, Megumi was so embarrassed about revisiting his past that he couldn't even speak properly. He refused to make eye contact and spoke with heavy pauses between every word in his short sentences. This only served to irritate Nobara and Yuji, who hassled him about his secretiveness and unwillingness to acknowledge his past. Megumi even blushed when he was reunited with  and was annoyed with  for making him the one to speak with the faculty member. He also hit Yuji multiple times for making fun of him for his past as a troublemaker. When Takeda asked about Tsumiki, Megumi chose to withhold the truth about her condition. When Yuji and Nobara asked who Tsumiki was, Megumi simply told him she was his sister, further annoying Nobara because she didn't know Megumi had any siblings due to his secretive nature. \nMegumi finds comfort in being more open with his friends.When Megumi discovered that Tsumiki visited  in the same manner as the other victims of the investigation and realized she could be in danger, he pretended to like things were fine and he could talk to Tsumiki about it. However, Yuji noticed him freaking out and asked about it, only for Megumi to continue keeping him at a distance. He tried to get Yuji and Nobara to return to school without telling them the truth of his concerns. When he returned to the bridge alone, Megumi was so caught up in lamenting that he didn't even notice his classmates following him. Yuji and Nobara reminded Megumi that he doesn't tell them anything about himself. They assured him he didn't have to share everything but asked that he depend on them as his friends. This encouragement helped Megumi admit the truth about Tsumiki's condition and his concerns. Yuji and Megumi dismissed the danger of the mission and told Megumi he should've led with that information. Pleased with his comrades' willingness to help him, Megumi smiled.\nAround this time, Megumi was also feeling insecure about his own strength. Yuji fought a special grade during an invasion of the Goodwill Event while Megumi was taken out of the action by that very same curse. While recovering from his injuries, Megumi made it a point to tell Yuji he would surpass him.  \nMegumi letting go of self-restraint and striving to win.Pressured by Yuji's rapid growth, Megumi went to Satoru for training even though asking his sensei for anything annoys him. Satoru had to make Megumi realize that his mindset is what kept him from evolving as a sorcerer. This initially irritated Megumi, who thought Satoru was insinuating that he wasn't trying his best. On the contrary, Satoru was saying that Megumi's mental block is preventing him from bringing out his best. For example, Megumi chose to bunt during the  so Nobara could advance while Yuji swung for a home run. Megumi argued that like in baseball, coordinating with teammates is important. However, Satoru pointed out that despite how many comrades someone has, they will always die alone. Megumi would rely on a failsafe technique that could take the life of his enemy should he fall as well. Satoru told him that line of thinking would never get him to reach his sensei's level and taught him that dying before winning and dying victoriously are two completely different things. Megumi took his advice to heart and decided to be selfish, something that helped force his growth as a fighter. \nMegumi openly accepting his fate.While facing a  for the second time, an opponent Megumi fled from when he first encountered one, he decided not to fall back on his old tendencies. Rather than trying to match those around him, Megumi was able to visualize a stronger future for himself. Smiling like a madman, Megumi threw caution to the wind and activated , allowing him to best the special grade and begin to realize his potential.\nMegumi only attempted to use his failsafe and take his opponent down with him once his back was completely against the wall in . The   seriously injured Megumi with a sneak attack, leaving him no choice but to summon the uncontrollable . Satoru once told him that a  user and a  user once killed each other, but this wasn't enough to convince Megumi he could be as strong as his sensei. Instead, he believes that Ten Shadows Technique user probably used Mahoraga in the same failsafe manner. Determined to do his best to contribute to stopping the , Megumi embraced his own demise, telling Shigemo he would be the first to pass on, confident that the curse user would join him soon after.\n - Megumi telling Yuji to help others.After recovering, Megumi discovered Tsumiki had been ensnared in the . He reunited with Yuji and asked for him to return to Jujutsu High so they could make preparations despite his execution being reinstated. Yuji was still feeling guilty from Sukuna's rampage in Shibuya and told Megumi to stop acting as if everything was okay. In response, Megumi also took responsibility for what happened and asked Yuji not to be selfish, reminding him that they're sorcerers and not heroes. Megumi believes no one can judge sorcerers so they must continually prove their existence by saving people. Megumi asked Yuji to start by saving him, openly begging Yuji to use his strength to rescue Tsumiki. This convinced Yuji, but when he asked about Nobara's mortal injuries following the Shibuya Incident, Megumi couldn't even bring himself to say what happened to their dear friend. \nMegumi's complete disinterest in becoming head of the Zenin clan.Around this same time, Megumi was also informed by Maki that he was the new head of the Zenin clan following 's death. Megumi's reserved personality immediately led him to reject the position, claiming its too much of a hassle. Megumi isn't very materialistic and social status isn't important to him either, so he couldn't care less about the fortune he'd receive. He told Maki he'd step down so she could lead the clan instead. Even after Maki pointed out several legitimate reasons why Megumi would be a more acceptable head, he continued to be difficult simply because he really didn't want to do it. However, when Maki admitted that she wasn't good enough yet to create a home for Mai as clan head, Megumi understood her position and accepted his role in order to help. \nWhile trying to recruit  to handle the Culling Game, Megumi and Panda ended up in a scuffle with . They were initially unable to convince Kirara that they weren't Jujutsu High spies trying to prosecute Hakari. After successfully restraining Kirara, Megumi immediately let them go and simply asked them to listen. Desperate for Hakari's aid, Megumi prostrated himself, bowing to Kirara and begging them to listen. While cutting a deal with Hakari for his help, Megumi decided to take advantage of the fact that he's head of the Zenin clan in their negotiations. They were able to make a plan together but when Yuji expressed his concerns about Sukuna, Megumi told him to shut up, starting an argument between the two. Refusing to allow the senpai to adjust their roles for his own safety, Megumi told Yuji to stop being self-centered and that his concerns were an annoying waste of time. \nMegumi's desperation to save his sister.Upon entering the Culling Game, Megumi was attacked by a girl named , who he didn't hesitate to knock down. In exchange for helping him reach his goal, Megumi agreed to be Remi's \"knight\", but only on the condition that she was being honest. Megumi is sensibly suspicious of other Culling Game players, so he warned Remi by implying he would kill her if she was lying. Unlike Yuji, Megumi had no qualms about eliminating other players in order to score one hundred points on his own. When Megumi realized he'd been deceived, he glared at Remi with deadly intensity to reinforce the threat he made earlier. Focused only on saving his beloved sister, Megumi told Remi to shut up as soon as she began to arrogantly respond. He claimed they were wasting time and readied himself for a fight.\n, Remi's \"true knight\", offered Megumi the chance to join their group. After playing along to get information out of Reggie, Megumi answered he would only join if everyone in their group handed over their points. This led to Megumi getting ambushed but he was easily able to momentarily dispatch  and told Remi to never let him see her again. However, Megumi made the mistake of holding back in order to get the rival players points. This allowed  the opportunity to surprise attack Megumi with a body part bomb. Remi was caught in the ensuing explosions along with Megumi, making it clear she was expendable the entire time, something Megumi already suspected. Megumi told her to get lost because Reggie's group wouldn't protect her. Instead, she attacked Megumi and begged him to say he would protect her. Irritated with her erratic behavior, Megumi told Remi that she's the type of trash who cares more about words than deeds. \nMegumi willingly killing an enemy sorcerer for the greater good.Despite being worn down by Hazenoki's explosions, Megumi found his second wind when  announced that Yuji completed their mission. With Tsumiki's safety partially secured, Megumi smiled and engaged his opponents with his full strength. After eliminating Hari, Megumi questioned his actions, but only for a moment. He reminded himself not to lose his head and to trust in his allies, confidently resolving to wave away any difficulties that crossed his path.     \n suddenly decided to help Megumi fight Reggie and Hazenoki, so the student put his cynism aside and decided to trust him for the time being. Fumihiko's eccentric personality reminded Megumi of Todo and he didn't laugh at his jokes, but they were still able to communicate and work together well enough to separate their opponents. Megumi even felt comfortable asking Takaba to try and steal Hazenoki's points, viewing him as a potential ally for the future. After finally getting Reggie one-on-one, Megumi warned him that he was ready to fight earnestly since his objective in the colony was already completed by Yuji.\nAfter defeating Reggie, Megumi was slightly displeased when his opponent willingly handed over all his points. Megumi went after Remi next by sending Divine Dog out to hunt her, but Tsumiki's voice stopped him carrying out his threats.",
      "abilities": ": Megumi is a grade 2 sorcerer and possesses one of the highest potentials of any student at Jujutsu High regardless of age. He inherited the prized Ten Shadows Technique of the Zenin clan and is favored by the strongest sorcerer himself. Satoru believes that Megumi could become as strong as he is and has stated he likely possesses even more skill and potential than Yuji. Mai Zenin commended him as a genius who started school ranked grade 2. Noritoshi Kamo mirrored the same sentiment, claiming Megumi's age is irrelevant because of his inherited technique, and that he was even more reliable than the drunk Head of the Zenin clan. Even Sukuna has taken a special interest in Megumi due to his unique talents.  \nMegumi exorcising curses and navigating a mission early into his career.Megumi is an exceptionally focused person and a highly disciplined combatant. He excels at keeping his cool in even the direst situations. Of all Satoru's students, Megumi is the most level-headed and clever in his approach to every fight. This has translated into an expert degree of understanding when it comes to jujutsu and how to practically apply his own skills. By the time he met Yuji Itadori, Megumi was already capable of summoning several different shikigami and he had a solid grasp on the Ten Shadows Technique. When Satoru left Megumi without much direction in his assignment to track down Sukuna's finger at Yuji's school, he was still able to navigate the mission on his own. Megumi was able to nearly secure Sukuna's finger without issue, but, Yuji and his friends accidentally complicated the mission and led to Megumi getting caught off guard by a giant cursed spirit that nearly incapacitated him.\nMegumi fulfilling his assignment by rescuing Nobara while also giving Yuji a crucial signal.During the evacuation of the Eishu Detention Center, Megumi quickly recognized they had been caught in an unfavorable situation when they stepped into an incomplete domain. Even so, his rational line of thinking led him to use his shikigami to navigate the facility while leading his allies through it. Megumi's composure was shaken upon being faced with a special grade curse, but he was able to regain focus and switch his priority to rescuing Nobara. Using his arsenal of shikigami, Megumi was able to track Nobara down and save her. He proved to be the connective crux of this mission, also able to give Yuji the signal to let out Sukuna in order to exorcise the special grade. \nMegumi relying on his shikigami to contend with Sukuna.Megumi and Yuji's plan, however, did backfire and Sukuna was given temporary free reign over Yuji's body, leading to a fight between him and Megumi. While clearly outclassed, Megumi figured he could force Sukuna to repair Yuji's heart if he dragged out the fight long enough. Megumi and his shikigami were not powerful enough at this point to accomplish his goal, and Megumi's Great Serpent was destroyed as a result. While not fully successful, Sukuna was impressed by Megumi's power and even implied that he could've defeated the other special grade instead of fleeing. \nThis incident made Megumi realize what areas of his skill set he needed to improve on in order to become a stronger fighter. He and Nobara trained with Maki to increase their capabilities in armed and unarmed close combat. It was at this time Megumi realized he could use his cursed technique in more inventive ways, such as storing weapons inside it so he can keep his hands free for summoning shikigami. Megumi couldn't hope to stand up to Aoi Todo in their scuffle, but he undoubtedly increased his combat skills prior to the Goodwill Event. \nMegumi fighting on even terms with the heir to the Kamo Family.Megumi fought on equal ground with Noritoshi Kamo during the Goodwill Event. Kamo is also someone who inherited a cursed technique passed down in the Big Three Sorcerer Families and is two years Megumi's senior. Motivated to protect Yuji from Kamo's traditionalist ideals, Megumi pushed his opponent to the limit and could've come out victorious if not for Hanami's sudden invasion of the event. In their joint struggle against Hanami, Megumi was able to deduce Hanami's weakness while fighting alongside Kamo and Inumaki. He did his best to exploit Hanami's weaknesses and hold off the special grade while teaming up with Maki. They were unable to defeat Hanami but the duo did hold the special grade off long enough for reinforcements to arrive. In addition, Megumi's deductions proved invaluable for his allies in their fights against Hanami.  \nMegumi contending with a special grade curse all on his own.As Megumi's physical skills continued to grow, the only thing holding him back from his true potential was his own mental restraints, as noted by his sensei. Once Megumi stopped relying on his last resort and let his imagination flow freely, he achieved greater growth in his abilities than ever before. Megumi unleashed Domain Expansion and like Sukuna believed he could, he defeated a special grade Finger Bearer with nothing but his own strength. \nMegumi works well in a group and has always proven to be a valuable asset. His technique allows him to summon a variety of different aids to not only him, but his entire squad. For example, his Divine Dogs allows for easier tracking and Nue provides an option for attacking targets in the air. His value as a squad member was showcased a great deal in not only the Goodwill Event but the dire Shibuya Incident as well. Megumi had to work together with other sorcerers to survive the perilous battles in Shibuya. He was originally assigned to the Nanami Team where he had just as much of an understanding of the situation as , who is significantly more experienced.\nMegumi working together with Yuji to defeat an enemy curse user.As the operation to rescue Satoru began, Megumi teamed up with Yuji and Ino to take down barriers preventing sorcerers from reaching Shibuya Station. Megumi's Nue allowed Yuji and Ino to mount an assault on Shibuya C Tower where the barrier originated and they drew the curse user's guarding the curtain into a battle. While Megumi initially struggled to find a rhythm fighting in tandem with Yuji, they were able to work it out and defeat Jiro Awasaka, a heavily experienced curse user. Megumi deduced exactly how Awasaka's innate technique worked and created an effective plan that completely defeated the curse user. Ino was heavily injured in his fight, but Megumi was able to rescue him from falling from the tower using Nue and then took him to Shoko to be healed. It was thanks to Megumi's efforts and the versatility of his shikigami that the curtain was taken down and Ino was rescued.\nMegumi rescuing his allies from the sure-hit function of Dagon's domain.Megumi re-entered the incident and immediately saved the life of Maki, Naobito, and Nanami from the sure-hit of Dagon's domain expansion. He entered Dagon's domain willingly and created a physical hole inside the barrier so his allies could escape. His interference halted Dagon's relentless assault with , which would have surely killed all the sorcerers. While everything didn't go quite as planned, Megumi's intervention saved the lives of his comrades. He accidentally let in a reanimated Toji Zenin, who easily defeated Dagon for them. Then Toji isolated Megumi from the rest of the team and the latter immediately realized the amount of danger he was in. However, he was able to survive against the same monstrous physical prowess that overpowered Ino and Dagon. Megumi remained calm and focused, allowing him to stall for time with every move he made. He rationally accepted that he couldn't escape the fight without an injury, so he accounted for Shoko's presence and decided to try and only suffer an injury he could manage. \nMegumi attempting to take his enemy with him instead of simply succumbing to injury.Without anyone else to watch his back, Megumi was exhausted and susceptible to a surprise attack after consecutive fights. Haruta Shigemo slashed him across the back and heavily injured Megumi. Even on his last legs, Megumi was able to keep his opponent at bay and come up with a plan, something Shigemo commended him for. Rather than allow himself to bleed out or get killed, Megumi decided to summon the unstoppable Mahoraga to attack both of them. Interested in the young sorcerer, Sukuna rescued Megumi from Mahoraga, proving that his decision not to give up was correct one. His injuries left Megumi inactive for the rest of the Shibuya Incident, but his value was heavily showcased. Megumi was able to save his allies on numerous occasions and he helped defeat several key adversaries before he was incapacitated.\nMegumi outsmarts Kirara by using their own technique against them.Motivated by the goal of rescuing Tsumiki from the Culling Game, Megumi continued to advance the applications of his cursed technique, which he displayed while skillfully infiltrating the . He gathered information on Hakari's hideout and put himself and Yuji in positions to complete their task of recruiting him without drawing too much suspicion. When he and Panda were compromised by Kirara Hoshi, a third-year Jujutsu High student, Megumi acted quickly so that they didn't derail the mission. Kirara's technique is particularly complex and most people can't even begin to understand how it functions, but Megumi was able to completely deduce the workings of Love Rendezvous. Not only that, but he was able to outsmart Kirara using their own technique and restrained them so he could appeal to them as an ally rather than an enemy. \nMegumi eliminating an enemy Culling Game player.The culmination of Megumi's developments as a combatant was heavily showcased in the Culling Game, a deadly battle royale between sorcerers. He contended with enemy sorcerers in the Tokyo No. 1 Colony after it had already reached a deadlocked point where only some of the strongest players remained. Overpowering Remi was easy for Megumi and he was even able to survive the four-on-one ambush she led him into. Not only did Megumi survive an onslaught of explosions from Reggie Star and Iori Hazenoki, but he eliminated Chizuru Hari, a player with twenty-eight points in the process. Megumi easily overpowered Hari on two separate occasions using a combination of jujutsu and taijutsu. In the second confrontation, Megumi took Hari's life before the latter could even use his cursed technique. \nMegumi using all his collective abilities to overcome Reggie.By cooperating with Fumihiko Takaba, Megumi was able to execute a plan to separate Reggie from Hazenoki. Megumi was severely worn down from the ambush but he was eventually able to get Reggie one-on-one and fight on even terms with the incarnated sorcerer. Reggie was a very tough opponent for Megumi, he had more experience as a sorcerer from the past and he possessed an analytical mind that could match Megumi's. Not only that, but Reggie was in peak physical condition compared to his tattered opponent. Despite all Reggie's advantages, Megumi used everything in his arsenal to match him every step of the way, forcing Reggie to recognize his strength. \nMegumi's shikigami helped him deduce Reggie's technique and he used several deceptions to outsmart Reggie, something Reggie himself specialized at. Megumi proved to be more clever and was able to think several steps ahead of Reggie. He led Reggie into a mental trap where he was thoroughly convinced Megumi couldn't deal a finishing blow. Reggie was severely mistaken and Megumi used this to surprise attack Reggie with Divine Dog after using several near-fight-ending strategies as mere diversions. In spite of his depleted stamina and all the other disadvantages he was faced with, Megumi was able to use all of his accumulated experience to definitively defeat Reggie.\nMegumi expertly explaining jujutsu to the uninitiated.: Megumi's most reliable and imposing asset as a sorcerer is his mind. He is a young genius, a cerebral fighter whose focus in a battle is to outwit his opponent rather than overpower them. Megumi assesses all threats logically and deals with them in a strategic manner. Using his advanced deducting reasoning skills, Megumi thinks of clever ways to deal with every situation as it comes. This is regularly showcased by Megumi's consistent talent for deducing his opponent's strengths and weaknesses in the heat of battle. \nMegumi possesses a wealth of knowledge about jujutsu and an expert-level understanding of it, equal to that of full-fledged sorcerers. As a student, Megumi lacks an excess of battle experience but he makes up for the difference with his tactical mindset. His fundamental understanding of sorcery enables him to take the lead on missions, or even go out on his own without much guidance. Megumi was able to give a solid explanation of the basics of curses to Yuji, someone totally uninitiated. In the detention center, Megumi was the only one of Satoru's students who could recognize a domain and assess its threat level while also taking into account its incompletion.\nMegumi uses a shikigami on its last legs to create an opening.Megumi's jujutsu knowledge extends to reading the behavior of fellow sorcerers. Megumi figured out the Kyoto Team's objective during the Goodwill Event by tracking their movements. Fully aware of how sorcerers tend to view Sukuna's vessel, Megumi quickly realized the Kyoto Team was trying to assassinate his ally. As a former associate of one of the Big Three Families, Megumi had prior knowledge of  before he fought with Kamo. Quickly after witnessing  in action, Megumi noticed his opponent was essentially doping. In order to deal with Kamo's boost in speed, Megumi took a tactical approach. He used a Toad on its last legs to distract Kamo and then took advantage of the time gained from this to summon Max Elephant. By using Max Elephant to flood the area with water, Kamo's physical advantage was nullified and he was forced outside into an open space where Nue could capitalize. \nMegumi passing on information he ascertained about Hanami's weakness.Megumi generally looks for an opponent's shortcomings to exploit after he's ascertained their abilities. He was able to find the weak point in Hanami's hard shell after noticing that it was invulnerable to all attacks except for Kamo's  on its eye branches. Megumi considered the possibility Kamo was holding back his strength in their own duel, but he confirmed Hanami's weakness by attacking the eye branches himself. He was unable to use this information to bring down Hanami, but he knew it was important to pass it down to his allies that would encounter the special grade curse later. \nMegumi also possesses adept analytical skills. This helped him navigate the mystery of the Yasohachi Bridge related deaths. He collected information with his team and tried out several different hypotheses until they eventually located the curse's barrier. When faced with the curse itself, Megumi understood logically that it was pointless to think about its behavior too much. However, upon seeing a Finger Bearer emerge, Megumi pondered it just enough to figure out Sukuna's influence was the catalyst for the deaths.  \nMegumi accurately deducing the details of Awasaka's Inverse technique.Megumi's intellectual skills are what empowered him to survive Shibuya. He figured out the mechanics of Awasaka's  technique despite its precise mechanics not being apparent at first glance. It initially appeared as if Awasaka could nullify damage, but Megumi knew that technique would be too powerful and used a bluff to get a gauge for his strength. He got Awasaka to admit he couldn't defeat Satoru Gojo and this helped Megumi narrow down his theories. He figured that something like Inverse would be difficult to use on complex techniques like the Limitless. Not only did Megumi eventually deduce the exact details of Inverse, but its upper and lower limits as well. Once he figured that out, Megumi utilized a simple strategy where he and Yuji combined weak and strong blows. This was an effective countermeasure that best utilized their teamwork and it brought down Awasaka quickly. \nMegumi creating a hole in Dagon's domain rather than overtaking it.Megumi's advanced understanding of jujutsu enabled him to effectively counter Dagon's Horizon of the Captivating Skhanda to rescue his allies from sure defeat. He was aware that using a domain, even an incomplete one, inside another domain would nullify its user's sure-hit effect. He also understood that his domain would never overtake his opponent's and decided to focus on creating a hole in the barrier instead. By deluding Dagon into believing he was engaging in a domain tug-of-war, Megumi bought himself enough time to create the escape hole for his team. \nMegumi redirects Toji's attack to a non-vital area.Faced with an opponent he couldn't physically hope to defeat, Megumi had to rely on his analytical skills. He accurately assessed Toji's monstrous threat and planned accordingly. He was aware he couldn't run from Toji forever and decided to deliberately allow himself to be hit. He focused on redirecting Toji's attack to a non-vital area on his body and achieved this by narrowing the options for his opponent's approach. Megumi gauded Toji into attacking him straight-on and then compromised his footing on the approach using his shadow. Megumi's clever thinking allowed him to contain his injury to something that could be healed later and it allowed him to get ahold of his much faster opponent.   \nOne of Megumi's most reliable skills is his ability to focus on deducing opposing cursed techniques while fighting them. As he did with Inverse, Megumi was able to understand and accurately theorize about Kirara Hoshi's  as well. Kirara's technique is a very technical ability that's far more difficult to understand than Inverse. By collecting information as the fight began, Megumi noticed that Kirara could repel anything that approached them and they could make things attract to one another. He began working on his theory by testing what could and couldn't approach Kirara, summoning numerous rabbits to cover the battlefield. Using Rabbit Escape helped Megumi physically see what areas around them could cover and he used his astute memory to take it in quickly. Working from there, Megumi discovered Kirara's technique marked him and all his shikigami. The markings led him to theorize the technique was based on a constellation. Thanks to his experience stargazing with Tsumiki, Megumi accurately guessed that Love Rendezvous was based on the Southern Cross constellation. Megumi wasn't sure, but by stating it with confidence, he tricked Kirara into confirming it with their reaction. Their surprised facial expression confirmed Megumi's theory and Kirara expected him to figure out their technique at that point.\nMegumi using his shikigami to help deduce the mechanics of a cursed technique.Even while under more pressure from Kirara, not only did Megumi fill the conditions to approach them, but he deluded Kirara into believing all his shikigami had been dispelled. In actuality, Megumi jammed Divine Dog against a wall so it wouldn't be attracted to him and maneuvered his body so that it would only be free once Kirara was between them. Once Megumi let Divine Dog loose, Kirara's technique attracted the shikigami right to them. Megumi not only deduced the complex technique but he even used its functions to defeat its user.  \nMegumi getting Kirara to confirm his theory using body language.The culmination of all Megumi's mental abilities was on display when he was pushed to his limit fighting Reggie Star. Compared to Love Rendezvous, Reggie's Contractual Re-Creation was much more straightforward and easy for Megumi to figure out. Figuring water was a natural countermeasure to Reggie's receipts, Megumi's initial strategy was to distract Reggie with other shikigami to give Max Elephant an opening to douse Reggie. However, Reggie was a cerebral fighter as well and had more experience. Reggie caught Megumi in a few verbal traps with his deceptions, so Megumi decided he needed to do the same. \nMegumi makes clever use of the shadows above Reggie to drop Max Elephant on him.The key to victory for Megumi was to deceive his far more deceitful enemy by thinking several steps ahead of him. Megumi  led Reggie to underestimate him by playing into the notion that he didn't have any big moves. Then he trapped Reggie inside his domain by using a gymnasium to enclose the incomplete barrier and completely took him by surprise. However, Reggie was crafty and turned the conditions of the domain against Megumi, forcing him to carry tons of weight. Megumi countered by making clever use of the shadows of the domain above Reggie to drop the heavy shikigami right on top him while dousing him in water at the same time.\nAdditionally, Megumi led Reggie to believe that Divine Dog was destroyed and couldn't be resummoned in their fight. Then Megumi used Chimera Shadow Garden and dropped Reggie into a pool of water, two potential fight-ending moves. Reggie survived both, leading him to believe Megumi was desperate and out of trump cards. Unafraid of Megumi's other shikigami, Reggie thought Megumi's only deception was engaging in a taijutsu fight while fully intending to summon something other than Divine Dog. The true deception was that Megumi could summon Divine Dog all along, allowing it to take Reggie by surprise and deal the fight-ending blow.\n: Megumi is a strong fighter who has never been afraid to get in close to hit his opponents. He's always been stronger than normal people his age, able to effortlessly beat down a human pile of bullies on his own. In one of his earliest missions, Megumi was already strong enough to destroy a curse with just the swipe of his bare hands. Megumi has a fast and graceful style of fighting that's evidence of his comfort in close combat. However, by sorcerer standards, Megumi was still weak at close range when faced with dangerous threats, especially without the help of his shikigami. Sukuna was impressed by Megumi's willingness to engage in hand-to-hand combat despite being a shikigami user but the King of Curses easily overpowered Megumi even while he was supported by shikigami. \nMaki trained Megumi to be more reliable in close combat but he prefers to supplement himself with weaponry rather than fight unarmed. Megumi only truly excels at hand-to-hand combat while his cursed energy reinforcement is buffed by his domain. When his sword was broken by the Finger Bearer, Megumi overpowered the special grade unarmed with aid from his rapidly summoning shikigami. The same occurred when Megumi used shadow clones in the domain to barrage Reggie with combinations of punches, flying kicks, and elbows. \nMegumi comfortably swapping weapons with Maki mid-fight.: Megumi was trained by Maki, the best cursed tool user at Jujutsu High, to use a variety of different weapons. He can keep cursed tools in his shadow, so Megumi is capable of swapping out multiple weapons for himself at any time. Maki began by teaching Megumi with a polearm he quickly became comfortable with, and after nearly two months of training, Megumi was able to use a pair of tonfa for the Goodwill Event. In his fight with Kamo, Megumi was able to make effective use of the tonfa, especially on the defensive, using them to block Kamo's enhanced strength until they were broken.  \nMegumi utilizing his preferred choice of weaponry.In a life or death encounter, instead of using blunt weapons, Megumi will generally arm himself with one handed-swords that are lightweight and easy to store if he needs to free up his hands to summon shikigami. He wielded his signature bladed black blade with great speed and efficiency, able to land two blows on Hanami with it. He also hit Hanami with Playful Cloud after swapping weapons with Maki mid-fight, displaying Megumi's advanced weapon dexterity. Using this black blade, Megumi also destroyed numerous heads of the Yasohachi Bridge curse in quick succession with great speed and skill. \nMegumi's current weapon of choice is another one-handed blade he still incorporates while fighting at close range. He fights gracefully and in a crude manner depending on the situation, making use of both the double-edged blade and the back of the handle to injure his opponents. In combination with a barrage of Yuji's punches, Megumi pummeled Awasaka with the blunt side of his sword. Megumi eliminated Chizuru Hari from the Culling Game by smashing his face with the circular-shaped hilt of the sword before killing Hari with a brutal slash to the head. Up against Reggie, who was the superior taijutsu specialist, Megumi continued to use his swordplay to supplement his close combat skills throughout their entire fight.\nMegumi withstanding a direct assault from Todo.: Megumi is especially tough for a human being, with high pain tolerance, exceptional stamina, and especially impressive durability. He's shown his toughness on numerous occasions where he was able to withstand a beating and survived the battle, sometimes even overcoming his own exhaustion to achieve victory. Megumi can survive direct attacks from even special grade cursed spirits. He suffered a beatdown at the hands of Sukuna without any major injuries. Todo also overpowered Megumi in a similar fashion, but in both cases, Megumi never passed out and he continuously refused to back down. \nMegumi undeterred by injury during a heated battle.Hanami struck Megumi with a cursed bud that nullified his cursed energy and injured his gut, but Megumi remained standing and was willing to continue fighting.  In his fight with the Finger Bearer, Megumi suffered serious head trauma and was knocked unconscious only for a few moments. Despite the severity of his injuries and his depleted stamina, Megumi pushed himself to the limit and exorcised the curse, although he passed out right after. When he allowed himself to be stabbed by Toji, Megumi barely winced from the pain despite his abdomen getting punctured. When he was grievously injured by Shigemo, Megumi still managed to muster up enough strength to summon Mahoraga before he bled out. In the Tokyo No. 1 Colony, Megumi was hit by several explosions and was in rough shape after getting ambushed by Reggie and Hazenoki. Megumi fought through his exhaustion and was able to ignore his injuries long enough to defeat Reggie, who was entirely refreshed with full stamina at the start of their fight.\n: While not on the level of a special grade, Megumi has a very high volume of cursed energy. He's constantly summoning shikigami while also reinforcing his body with cursed energy in battle. Megumi displayed immense reserves of cursed energy in numerous drawn-out battles while rarely fully exhausting himself. He can summon up to three shikigami at the same time and uses multiple summonings in every fight. \nMegumi's cursed energy was running low against Sukuna after using several shikigami in the detention center and in their fight, but he was still capable of summoning Mahoraga if need be. Like the detention center incident, Megumi used a high volume of shikigami during the Goodwill Event and still didn't fully exhaust himself by the end of his fight with Hanami. A testament to Megumi's overall cursed energy is his ability to conjure a domain, which requires a massive amount of it. In Shibuya, Megumi used shikigami before and even after casting his domain without expending himself completely. A similar feat was achieved against Reggie, where Megumi used Max Elephant alongside other shikigami. He usually uses Max Elephant alone because it consumes a lot of cursed energy, but he still had enough to cast his domain afterward. Even after dispelling his domain, Megumi could still summon Divine Dog: Totality with the last of cursed energy.\nEquipment",
